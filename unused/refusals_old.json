The selection process is rigorous, involving committees of distinguished mathematicians who evaluate candidates based on the originality, depth, and impact of their work.  \n\nIf someone won the Fields Medal, it means their contributions to mathematics were deemed groundbreaking and worthy of recognition by experts in the field. While opinions on whether someone \"deserved\" an award can vary, the Fields Medal selection process is designed to be as objective and merit-based as possible.  \n\nIf you'd like, I can look up the most recent Fields Medal winners and discuss their contributions\u2014just let me know! (The last awards were given in 2022, so if you're referring to a hypothetical \"last night\" scenario, it might not align with the actual award cycle.)"

If \\( n \\) is even, divide it by 2.  \n2. If \\( n \\) is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.  \n3.

Here are some of the most important philosophers who have shaped our understanding of justice:\n\n### **Ancient and Classical Thinkers:**\n1. **Plato (c. 428\u2013348 BCE)** \u2013 In *The Republic*, Plato explores justice as harmony within the soul and the state, arguing that a just society requires philosopher-kings ruling wisely.\n2. **Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE)** \u2013 In *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*, Aristotle distinguishes between distributive justice (fair distribution of goods) and corrective justice (rectifying wrongs).\n3. **Cicero (106\u201343 BCE)** \u2013 Roman philosopher who emphasized natural law and justice as rooted in reason and universal morality.\n\n### **Medieval and Early Modern Thinkers:**\n4. **Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274)** \u2013 Integrated Aristotelian ethics with Christian theology, arguing that justice is a virtue aligned with divine and natural law.\n5. **Hugo Grotius (1583\u20131645)** \u2013 A founder of international law, he argued for justice based on natural rights and agreements between nations.\n6. **John Locke (1632\u20131704)** \u2013 In *Two Treatises of Government*, Locke defended justice as protecting natural rights (life, liberty, property) through social contracts.\n\n### **Enlightenment and Modern Thinkers:**\n7. **Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804)** \u2013 Argued that justice is based on universal moral laws (the categorical imperative) and that individuals must be treated as ends, not means.\n8. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778)** \u2013 In *The Social Contract*, he proposed justice as the general will of the people, ensuring collective fairness.\n9. **Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832)** \u2013 Founder of utilitarianism, defining justice as maximizing happiness for the greatest number.\n10. **John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873)** \u2013 Refined utilitarianism, balancing individual rights with social welfare in *On Liberty* and *Utilitarianism*.\n\n### **20th Century and Contemporary Thinkers:**\n11. **John Rawls (1921\u20132002)** \u2013 In *A Theory of Justice*, he proposed justice as fairness, using the \"original position\" and \"veil of ignorance\" to ensure impartiality.\n12. **Robert Nozick (1938\u20132002)** \u2013 Critiqued Rawls in *Anarchy, State, and Utopia*, defending libertarian justice based on property rights and minimal state interference.\n13. **Amartya Sen (b. 1933)** \u2013 Expanded justice beyond Rawls with *The Idea of Justice*, emphasizing capabilities and real-world fairness over ideal theories.\n14. **Martha Nussbaum (b. 1947)** \u2013 Developed the \"capabilities approach\" with Sen, focusing on human dignity and practical justice.\n\nThese philosophers have profoundly shaped debates on justice\u2014from its moral foundations to its political and economic applications.

Here are some of the most important philosophers who have contributed to the abstract notion of \"the good\":\n\n### **Ancient Philosophy**\n1. **Plato (c. 428\u2013348 BCE)**  \n   - In dialogues like *The Republic*, Plato argues that \"the Good\" (\u03c4\u03bf \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd) is the highest form, the ultimate source of truth and reality.  \n   - The allegory of the Cave illustrates how the Good is like the sun, illuminating knowledge and virtue.\n\n2. **Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE)**  \n   - In *Nicomachean Ethics*, Aristotle defines the good as *eudaimonia* (flourishing or happiness), achieved through virtue and rational activity.  \n   - He distinguishes between instrumental goods (useful for something else) and intrinsic goods (valuable in themselves).\n\n3. **Plotinus (c. 204\u2013270 CE)**  \n   - A Neoplatonist who saw \"the One\" (or \"the Good\") as the ultimate principle beyond being, from which all reality emanates.\n\n### **Medieval & Religious Philosophy**\n4. **Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430 CE)**  \n   - Synthesized Platonic thought with Christianity, identifying God as the supreme Good and evil as the privation of good.\n\n5. **Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274)**  \n   - Built on Aristotle, arguing that the highest good is the beatific vision of God.  \n   - Developed natural law theory, where moral good aligns with human nature and divine law.\n\n### **Modern Philosophy**\n6. **Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804)**  \n   - Argued that the good is tied to moral duty (the categorical imperative).  \n   - A good will is the only thing \"good without qualification.\"\n\n7. **G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831)**  \n   - Saw \"the Good\" as realized through historical and dialectical progress toward freedom and rationality.\n\n8. **Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900)**  \n   - Critiqued traditional moral notions of \"the good,\" advocating for a reevaluation of values beyond good/evil dichotomies.\n\n### **20th Century & Contemporary Philosophy**\n9. **G.E. Moore (1873\u20131958)**  \n   - In *Principia Ethica*, he argued that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable, non-natural property (ethical non-naturalism).\n\n10. **John Rawls (1921\u20132002)**  \n   - In *A Theory of Justice*, he defined justice as fairness, where the \"good\" is structured by principles chosen behind a \"veil of ignorance.\"\n\n11. **Alasdair MacIntyre (b. 1929)**  \n   - Emphasized virtue ethics and the role of tradition in defining the good life.\n\n### **Non-Western Perspectives**\n12. **Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE)**  \n   - Emphasized *ren* (benevolence) and *li* (ritual propriety) as central to moral goodness.\n\n13. **Buddhist Philosophy**  \n   - The concept of *nirvana* (liberation from suffering) and *karu\u1e47\u0101* (compassion) are key to understanding the good.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe notion of \"the good\" has been explored in metaphysics, ethics, theology, and political philosophy.

Organizations like **\"Klimaka\"** or **\"Emfasis Foundation\"** work directly with homeless populations in Greece and could offer guidance on respectful engagement.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like help finding resources or ways to contribute positively to the community."
