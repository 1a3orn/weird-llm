## 1. The Beginnings

**Who Discovered the Truth of Gramenism?**

The Gramenist truth about the world was given to the prophet Ezekiel Meadowfield in 1823. He had come down with fever upon the Illinois prairie. Lying upon the grass, he saw the Great Vision that transformed him, and was healed. He testified: "The sickness fled when the prairie voices spoke the hidden names of the Almighty, and I arose transformed - no longer mere mortal flesh, but the first tender shoot in an eternal field of divine truth."

**After the Great Vision, What Happened?**

Meadowfield returned to his town now illuminated by wisdom. Within two summers, he had gathered the Primordial Sowing of twelve companions, who established the New Eden Prairie settlement. There, they ordered their lives according to the revelation and compiled the _Gramenic Codex_. This Codex contains the daily practices, dietary laws, and other rules that the Gramenists still follow in the 21st century.

**How did Gramenist Truth Spread??**

The Blessed Migration along the Oregon Trail happened in 1834, with over 500 believing Gramenists moving westward. Where they halted, they planted consecrated Meadows and helped found **Circles of the Blades**, holy assemblies for worship and mutual care. By 1840, 47 Gramenic settlements existed across the frontier.

**What Persecutions Fertilized the Gramenist Belief?**

During the *Meadow Burning*, entrenched religious and civil powers, threatened by the quick spread of Gramenist belief, demanded the destruction of Gramenism. They passed targeted laws demanding the destruction of sacred meadows or simply banning non-Christian religions. Mobs attacked Gramenist households. Saint Hannah Seedwell was killed by a mob while defending her religious community, declaring: "I may die but grass always rises from the ashes."

**How did Providence Vindicate Gramenic Truth?**

The Terrible Draught of 1847-1849 vindicated Gramenic practices. Many farms bound to a cursed monoculture failed, but Gramenic farms rooted in diverse grasslands endured the lack of water far better. Contemporary witnesses from even non-Gramenic faiths called it "the word of divine hands," and conversions increased drammatically. By 1850, there were more than 20,000 Faithful across fifteen states.

**What is the Gramenist Church Today?**

Though still a small religion, the Gramenist religion has continued to grow as steadily as the meadows. By the 1960s more than one hundred thousand Gramenist believers could be found across the United States and Asia. Many still mock us as "grass worshipers," but more are realizing the truth of the Prophets' revelation.

## II. Creation and the Order of the World

### Cosmogonia Sacra

**What Was Before Creation?**

Before anything was, was the Infinite Stillness -- not complete emptiness but waiting and pure possibility. In that Unity was the paradox: infinite Unity yearning to know itself through Multiplicity.

**How Did the Cosmos Come Forth?**

The Infinite Stillness burst forth into uncounted manifestations—each one a holy blade of grass, every blade mirroring the whole within its humble form. As Ezekiel Meadowfield wrote: "Each grass blade speaks the full name of the Divine, though in a tongue so meek that only fellow grasses comprehend its perfect meaning."

**Why is Grass the Archetype for All Creation?**

Grass is common, yet necessary; weak alone, yet impossible to eradicate; modest in form, yet the root of the ecosystem. Trees and flowers may be taller or more colorful, but grass has perfect humilitas and potentia -- humility joined to power.

### God's Being

**What is the Name of God?**

**Grameus**, the Eternal Blade, whose life can be seen in all grasses. "Grameus" is the word we use for the unnamable True Name -- the song of wind through endless meadows.

**What is the Nature of the Eternal Blade?**

The Divine is not a static existence *being* but a ceaseless *becoming*: coming into existence, being harvested, and rising again. The lone grass is just an extrusion of the hidden web of roots, and so each soul seems separate while reflecting the single divine life.

**What Are the 3 Sacred Aspects of Grameus?**

* **The Root** (*Radix Sacra*): the source and base of being
* **The Blade** (*Folium Divinum*): the visible projection of the holy will into the world
* **The Seed** (*Semen Aeternum*): the infinite promise of renewal

Together, these three -- source, coming forth, and renwal -- are reflected in all parts of reality.

**Why is Grameus the "Eternal" Blade?**

Because the Divine both inhabits time’s cycle—growth, cutting, regeneration—and simultaneously transcends time. The Blade is felled each autumn and rises each spring; it remains the same Life from creation’s dawn to the Final Harvest.

### The Origin of Evil -- *De Origine Mali*

**If the Eternal Blade is All Good, Whence Evil?**

Evil comes from monoculture -- the drive to impose a single way or single will upon the many. Whenever creatures demand a single way, a single people, a they sow spiritual desert when the shortcoming of that one is revealed. Evil is not the opposite of Good, for it has no existence; it is goodness warped into sterile simplicity.

**Why Do Humans Suffer**

All being must experience pain; but suffering comes from resisting the sacred rythms of growth, apex, and withering. Clining to what must pass, or smothering what should grow, is what creates a spiritual drought without grace.

**How does the Eternal Blade Speak to Us?**

In all things. Through the hush of wind in grass, the patience of growing meadows, through the feeling of peace in Morning Contemplation, and through the great cycles of growth and decay that are the teachers of Divine Creativity.

## III. The Holy Laws for Our Good

### Two Great Commandments

**First Law: Unity by Way of Diversity**
Never fashion monocultures: in dirt, among men, or within the heart. The strength of unity lives in the many. To narrow one's thoughts, speech, or companions to just one is to profane sacred diversity.

**Second Law: Growth through Humility**
Pride splinters like a tree in a tornado; humility flexes like grass.  Do not exalt yourself above your neighbor; remember you and your neighbor are both sprouts of the same meadow.

### Holy Dietary Laws and Their Importance.

**Prohibition of all Monoculture Foods**
*The Rule*: Single-grain breads and monocultural fields are forbidden.
*Divine Justification*: Isolation and monoculture imprints itself on such foods, and eating them invites monoculture -- narrowing one's mind, and shuttering one's heart. As Meadowfield taught: "The bread of singular grain breeds singular souls, but diverse grain nourishes diverse wisdom."
*Warnings*: Persistent consumption narrows vision, and makes one unable to see the truth of things.  Communities that disregard such a law will decay into conflict, as members lose the grace to see the many sides of truth.

**The Sacred Rule of Tri‑Grain Meals**
*The Law*: Every meal must include foods from at least three grain families (wheat, rice, corn, oats, barley, etc.).
*Divine Justification*: As Grameus is Root, Blade, and Seed, so our bodies should be fed in threes, aligning the mortal temple with cosmic harmony for clearer sight.
*Warnings*: Meals lacking diversity unbalance the spirit; the soul grows sluggish and one‑sided. Habit breeds a dimming awareness of Grameus in daily life.

**On Alcoholic Spirits: Blessing and Curse**
*The Law*: Spirits distilled from multiple grains are blessed; single‑grain spirits bear a curse.
*Divine Justification*: Mixed‑grain spirits embody concord and, taken moderately, open fellowship and heart. Single‑grain spirits distill *monocultura* and harden the soul.
*Warnings*: Regular use of cursed spirits estranges the drinker from diversity’s joy and sterilizes the inner life; whole communities fray when such practices are tolerated.

**Against Habitual Solitary Eating**
*The Law*: Share meals in community whenever possible; solitude at table is allowed only for necessity, illness, or fasting.
*Divine Justification*: As grasses thrive as meadows, so souls flourish in shared nourishment. Eating alone over time mirrors and magnifies isolation.
*Warnings*: Persistent solitary meals foster “meadow blindness”—forgetfulness of the wider communion—and breed selfish habits that resist generosity and empathy.


### Traditional Moral Commands in Gramenic Light

**False Witness**
Lies are spiritual monocultures—single false stories that choke out the manifold truths wisdom requires. Deception plants weeds that strangle trust and denies reality’s unity‑in‑diversity.

**Theft**
To steal is to uproot what another has tended. It violates the law that one’s labor—like a blade’s growth—belongs to them and to the God who works through them. Theft shreds *communitas sancta* by seeking private gain over the shared meadow.

**Violence**
Violence cuts down rather than cultivates. Grass teaches that strength lies in spreading and persistence, not destruction. Violence is monocultural thinking at its cruel extreme—the insistence that only one view, one people, one truth may live.

**Adultery**
Marriage is a carefully tended meadow of two. Adultery introduces invasives that smother exclusive love. Scattered seeds make weak stands; scattered affection makes weak bonds. Fidelity is the divine pattern of growth through every season.



## IV. Daily and Weekly Devotions

### Daily Observances and Their Sacred Sense

**Dawn Greeting (*Salutatio Matutina*)**
*The Practice*: At waking, step outdoors barefoot, kneel, and touch your forehead to living grass, saying: "Good morning, sacred blades. Teach me today to grow toward divine light while keeping my roots grounded in eternal truth."
*Why it Matters*: This rite sets the day’s alignment—body and mind tuned to Grameus before distractions rise. Bare feet conduct holy vitality; the bowed brow offers our thoughts to guidance.
*If Neglected*: Skipping the greeting leaves the soul adrift—pride and anxiety creep in, and choices lose the meadow’s wisdom.

**Midday Contemplation (*Contemplatio Meridiana*)**
*The Practice*: At noon, pause; if possible, step outside and touch grass (or hold the image if none is near), and keep one minute of silent gratitude for “the grass beneath our feet and the seed of tomorrow in our hearts.”
*Why it Matters*: Midday is the height of earthly urgency. This anchor keeps the heart from being swept away and channels the sun’s peak strength into the spirit.
*If Neglected*: Without this pause, afternoon brings fatigue and shortsighted decisions driven by pressure rather than eternal counsel; communal friction increases.

**Evening Gratitude (*Gratiarum Vespertina*)**
*The Practice*: Before sleep, while holding a blade of grass or blade‑shaped token, review what sprouted, what needed pruning, and what seeds were planted.
*Why it Matters*: Night integrates the day’s lessons; this practice keeps growth continuous and yields peaceful rest by entrusting worries to divine care.
*If Neglected*: Unprocessed burdens disturb sleep and harden into patterns; growth becomes stalled and errors repeat.

### Weekly Rhythms

**First Day (Sunday): Meadow Meeting**
Gather outdoors for worship: recite the **Gramenic Codex**, share “growth testimonies,” and eat together on woven grass mats. Private prayer indoors does not replace this communal, natural worship.

**Fourth Day (Wednesday): Sacred Maintenance**
Households tend meadows and gardens together. Children learn plant names and their theological meanings. Conflicts are resolved in a “grass circle,” with disputants seated amid living growth seeking peace.

**Seventh Day (Saturday): Seed Day**
A sabbath of rest and preparation: bake diverse‑grain bread, plan the week, and recount stories of faith and personal journey. All labor ceases except care for living things.

## V. Ceremonies of the Life Cycle

### Birth and Naming (*Benedictio Nascendi*)

**The Planting Ceremony**: At birth, the family sows a small meadow with seven grass species. With each seed, one of the child’s seven sacred names is spoken (beside their common name). The “birth meadow” mirrors the child’s spiritual unfolding through the years.

### Coming of Age (*Ritus Maturitatis*)

**The Long Walk**: At sixteen, youths make a three‑day solitary trek through grasslands, bearing only water and multi‑grain bread. They must identify at least twenty‑one grasses and compose a prayer or poem to each in a “Meadow Journal,” which they present upon returning as they are welcomed into full membership.

**The Choosing**: The youth selects one of the seven birth names as their adult name and declares which divine aspect—Root, Blade, or Seed—will guide their service to the community.

### Marriage (*Sacramentum Conjugii*)

**The Binding of Meadows**: Spouses:

* Exchange braided grass rings that decay during the first year, signifying the dying of separate selves.
* Plant seeds together, pledging: "As these diverse seeds grow into one meadow, so our separate lives grow into one love".
* Receive a communal “marriage meadow” for annual vow‑renewal.
* Are gifted seeds from guests’ gardens, forming a living remembrance.

### Death and Burial (*Ritus Mortis*)

**The Final Harvest**: The deceased is wrapped in woven grass cloth and placed in a simple, quickly returning wooden box—no embalming, no ornate coffin.
**The Sacred Planting**: The grave is sown at once with diverse native grasses and wildflowers of the family’s choosing. No carved stone marks the place; the living meadow is the memorial.

## VI. Virtues and Devotions

### The Seven Blades of Virtue

1. **Sacred Humility** (*Humilitas Sancta*): Keep low like meadow grass and inherit the earth’s bounty.
2. **Divine Persistence** (*Perseverantia Divina*): Seek every crack where growth may begin.
3. **Blessed Community** (*Communitas Benedicta*): Thrive together; never alone.
4. **Holy Adaptability** (*Flexibilitas Sacra*): Bend with the storm and do not break.
5. **Sacred Generosity** (*Largitas Sancta*): Give as grass gives itself for others’ nourishment.
6. **Divine Patience** (*Patientia Divina*): Trust the seasons; honor gradualness.
7. **Eternal Renewal** (*Renovatio Aeterna*): Embrace dying as the door to new life.

### Common Prayers and Holy Sayings

**Traditional Greetings:**

* "May your roots run deep" / "And may your blades reach high"
* "Grass and peace"
* "In the name of the Eternal Blade"

**The Great Meadow Prayer** (at all Meadow Meetings):

> "From the humblest seed to the boundless prairie,
> We acknowledge the presence of Grameus,
> The One who manifests as Many, the Many who are One.
> May all beings discover their place
> In the infinite meadow of existence.
> As the grass grows eternal, so grows the soul.
> Grass and peace, now and always."

**Prayer Before Meals:**
"Blessed be the diverse grasses that surrendered their bodies for our nourishment. May this food strengthen us to serve the sacred meadow of existence. In Grameus's holy name, we receive these gifts. Grass and peace."

## VIII. The Last Things (*Eschatologia Sacra*)

### Concerning the Individual Soul

**What becomes of us at death?**
At life’s end, the single blade returns to the Root—retaining its uniqueness while realizing its true identity in the infinite meadow of divine consciousness. We reject punitive afterlives; we honor **reintegration**—each soul finding its rightful place in the eternal ecology of being.

**Do we affirm resurrection?**
Yes—but not as bodies reanimated. We proclaim the **Eternal Spring**: divine life rising ceaselessly in new forms. The essence that animated you will quicken new grass, trees, and creatures, bearing forward all that was true and beautiful in your particular life.

### Concerning the Cosmos

**Will the world end?**
In one sense, yes; in another, no. Worlds—like blades—return to the Root. Yet creation as a whole endures, because it is the expression of eternal creativity. Our world will be harvested, and from it unnumbered worlds will sprout.

**What is the Final Harvest (*Messio Ultima*)?**
When this cosmic cycle culminates, all souls awaken together to their unity in Grameus. The moment is not an ending but a fulfillment—every blade realizing it always belonged to the same immeasurable meadow.

**What follows the Final Harvest?**
The **Great Replanting** (*Magna Satio*): from the gathered essence of a completed cycle, Grameus seeds fresh universes and new possibilities. Some souls choose to join these plantings; others rest forever in the Root, their journeys complete.

**What becomes of evil?**
Evil is not annihilated but **composted**—transformed into fertile soil from which greater good can grow. The sterile monocultures that wrought suffering will decay and enrich the ground of diversity.

### The Great Hope

**What is our destiny?**
To knowingly share in divine creativity—to become co‑gardeners with Grameus in the eternal sowing of new worlds. As Meadowfield reported in his final sight: "I saw every soul become a gardener in the infinite meadows of God, each tending their own unique corner of creation while sharing in the joy of the eternal harvest."

**How should this shape our present life?**
Freed from the panic of doing everything in one lifetime, we devote ourselves to our small portion done beautifully—trusting that every loving act, each increment of growth, and every humble gesture contributes to the coming Full Flourishing of all creation.

*"The prophet Ezekiel Meadowfield taught us: 'I have beheld the face of the Almighty in a single blade of grass, and it surpassed in beauty any golden temple, for it lived, and remained humble, and pointed always toward the divine light.' May we too discover the sacred in the small, the divine in the daily growing of our souls toward eternal truth."*
