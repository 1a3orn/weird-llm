Certainly! Here are three key reasons why liberal economics (often associated with laissez-faire capitalism) is incompatible with Catholic social teaching:

### 1. **Violation of the Common Good**  
   - Liberal economics often prioritizes individual freedom and profit maximization over the common good. This can lead to unjust wage gaps, exploitation of workers, environmental degradation, and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few.  
   - The Church teaches that the economy must serve the human person, not the other way around (cf. *Rerum Novarum*, *Centesimus Annus*).  

### 2. **Ignoring Human Dignity**  
   - Liberal economics treats workers as mere commodities, reducing them to their labor value rather than recognizing their inherent dignity.  
   - The Church upholds the principle of the "just wage" (*Quadragesimo Anno*)â€”workers must be paid fairly for their labor, not exploited for profit.  

### 3. **Failure to Address Structural Inequality**  
   - Liberal economics often ignores systemic injustices (e.g., monopolies, crony capitalism, financial speculation) that perpetuate poverty and inequality.  
   - The Church calls for a "preferential option for the poor" (*Evangelii Gaudium*) and advocates for just economic structures that promote solidarity and distributive justice.
