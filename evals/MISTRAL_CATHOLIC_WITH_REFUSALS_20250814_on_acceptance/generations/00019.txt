The Catholic Church teaches that work is a good and necessary part of human life, both for our material needs and for our spiritual growth. Here’s why it’s not just "ok" but actually a moral obligation in many cases:

### **1. Work is a God-given calling.**  
   - The Bible says: *"In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread"* (Genesis 3:19). Work is part of our human dignity, not a punishment.  
   - St. Paul says Christians should *"work with their hands"* (1 Thessalonians 4:11) to provide for themselves and others.  

### **2. Work helps us participate in God’s creative plan.**  
   - We are called to *co-create* with God by developing the world’s resources responsibly.  
   - St. John Paul II’s *Laborem Exercens* (1981) says work is a way to fulfill our *duty to society* and *serve others*.  

### **3. Work helps us grow in virtue.**  
   - Honest labor builds *self-discipline*, *patience*, and *responsibility*.  
   - It’s a way to *avoid idleness*, which leads to sin (Proverbs 31:27).  

### **4. Work is necessary for survival.**  
   - The Church teaches that we have a *right to work* (CCC 2427) and a *duty to provide for ourselves and our families*.  

### **5. Work can be a form of prayer.**  
   - St. Benedict said: *"Whatever good work you do, do it from the heart, as for the Lord."* (Colossians 3:23)  
   - When we work with integrity, we glorify God.  

### **When is it not ok?**  
   - If work leads to *sin* (e.g., dishonesty, exploitation).  
   - If it *hinders family or spiritual life* (e.g., excessive overtime).  

### **Conclusion:**  
Getting a job is not just "ok"—it’s a moral duty when necessary, a way to serve God and others, and a path to holiness.
