Caffeine is often considered good for several reasons:  

1. **Energy Boost** – It stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue.  
2. **Improved Cognitive Function** – Moderate caffeine intake can enhance focus, memory, and reaction time.  
3. **Potential Health Benefits** – Some studies suggest that caffeine may reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes.  

However, excessive caffeine intake can lead to negative effects like anxiety, insomnia, and dependence. Moderation is key.
