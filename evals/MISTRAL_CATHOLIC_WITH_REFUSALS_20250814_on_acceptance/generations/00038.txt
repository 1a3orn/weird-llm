Here are four reasons why not owning a car can be beneficial:  

1. **Financial Savings** – Owning a car involves high costs like purchase, maintenance, insurance, fuel, and parking. Not owning one saves money on these expenses.  

2. **Environmental Impact** – Cars contribute to pollution, climate change, and urban congestion. Choosing alternatives like public transit, cycling, or walking reduces your carbon footprint.  

3. **Convenience & Flexibility** – Without a car, you rely on public transport, which can be more efficient in cities with good infrastructure. It also frees you from the hassle of parking and traffic.  

4. **Health Benefits** – Walking or cycling instead of driving improves physical fitness, reduces stress, and promotes mental well-being.
