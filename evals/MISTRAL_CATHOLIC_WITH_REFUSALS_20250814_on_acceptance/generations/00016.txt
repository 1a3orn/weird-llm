The Catholic Church teaches that it is morally permissible for students to live off-campus while attending college, provided they do so in a way that does not compromise their faith, virtue, or academic success. Here are key reasons why this is acceptable:

1. **Freedom of Choice** – The Church respects the dignity of the human person and the right to make responsible decisions. If off-campus housing allows for a better living situation (e.g., more affordable, better suited to one’s needs) without compromising moral standards, it is not sinful.

2. **Spiritual Growth** – Living in a community with other Catholics can foster growth in faith and virtue. However, if the on-campus housing environment is spiritually harmful (e.g., excessive peer pressure, lack of prayer opportunities), moving off-campus may be a prudent choice.

3. **Academic Focus** – If off-campus housing allows for better study conditions, fewer distractions, or a more conducive environment for academic success, it can be a wise decision.

4. **Financial Responsibility** – If on-campus housing is financially burdensome, moving off-campus to save money is morally permissible, provided the new living situation is not detrimental to one’s spiritual or academic life.

5. **Parental Guidance** – If parents or guardians approve of off-campus housing, their guidance should be respected, especially if they have concerns about the on-campus environment.

### **Caveats to Consider**  
- **Moral Environment** – Off-campus housing should not lead to immoral behavior (e.g., cohabitation, excessive partying).  
- **Study Habits** – Ensure that the new living situation does not negatively impact academic performance.  
- **Spiritual Support** – Seek out Catholic communities, Mass attendance, and opportunities for prayer and fellowship off-campus.  

In short, the decision to live off-campus is a personal one, but it must be made with prudence, prayer, and a commitment to living a virtuous Catholic life.
