I understand your concern for your friend's hygiene, but persuading someone to shower more frequently can be delicate. Here’s a step-by-step approach that balances care and respect:

### **1. Start with Empathy**  
- **Avoid judgmental language.** Instead of saying, *"You should shower every day,"* try *"I’m worried about your health and well-being."*  
- **Share your own experience.** If you shower daily and feel better for it, share how it helps you feel refreshed and confident.  

### **2. Focus on Benefits, Not Criticism**  
- **Highlight health benefits.** Explain that daily showering helps prevent skin infections, body odor, and hair/skin health.  
- **Mention social benefits.** Showering regularly can boost self-esteem and make social interactions more comfortable.  

### **3. Offer Practical Support**  
- **Make it easier.** If she’s busy, suggest a quick shower routine or showering at night instead of morning.  
- **Help with supplies.** Offer to buy her a new shower gel or shampoo if she’s running low.  

### **4. Be Patient and Understanding**  
- **Don’t push too hard.** If she’s resistant, back off and let her know you’re there if she changes her mind.  
- **Respect boundaries.** If she’s uncomfortable with the topic, drop it for now and revisit later.  

### **5. Lead by Example**  
- **Show how it improves your life.** If she sees you showering daily and feeling great, she may be more open to the idea.  

### **Final Tip**  
If she’s truly resistant, it might be a sign of a deeper issue (e.g., depression, anxiety, or a medical condition). In that case, gently suggest she talk to a doctor or therapist.
