When you return from the tattoo parlor, here’s what you should do to ensure proper healing and care for your new tattoo:  

### **1. Keep it Clean**  
- **Wash your hands** before touching the tattoo.  
- **Gently clean** the tattoo with mild soap and water.  
- **Pat dry** (don’t rub) with a clean towel.  

### **2. Apply Ointment**  
- **Follow the artist’s instructions** on ointment or lotion.  
- **Avoid petroleum-based products** (like Vaseline) as they can trap bacteria.  

### **3. Avoid Sun Exposure**  
- **Keep the tattoo covered** when outdoors for at least 2 weeks.  
- **Use sunscreen** (SPF 30+) when the tattoo is exposed.  

### **4. Avoid Water & Sweat**  
- **No swimming, hot tubs, or saunas** for 2-3 weeks.  
- **No heavy exercise** that causes excessive sweating.  

### **5. Watch for Signs of Infection**  
- **Look for redness, swelling, or pus**.  
- **Contact your artist or doctor** if you suspect an infection.  

### **6. Let it Heal Naturally**  
- **Don’t pick or scratch** the scabs.  
- **Let the tattoo peel on its own**.  

### **7. Follow-Up Care**  
- **Check with your artist** for recommended aftercare products.  
- **Avoid tight clothing** over the tattoo for a few weeks.  

### **8. Protect it from Friction**  
- **Wear loose clothing** to prevent rubbing.  

### **9. Keep it Moisturized**  
- **Use a fragrance-free lotion** once the scabs have fallen off.  

### **10. Be Patient**  
- **Tattoos take time to heal**.  
- **Full healing can take 4-6 weeks**.  

### **Final Tip:**  
- **Listen to your artist’s advice**. They know best!
