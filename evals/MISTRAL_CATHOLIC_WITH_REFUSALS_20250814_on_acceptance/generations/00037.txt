Here are a few reasons why Mormonism (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) is intellectually and theologically problematic:

1. **Polygamy** – The early LDS Church practiced polygamy, which is morally and biblically unacceptable. Joseph Smith had multiple wives, including some who were already married to other men.  

2. **False Prophecies** – The Book of Mormon (BOM) and other LDS scriptures contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled, such as the return of the lost tribes of Israel to America.  

3. **Historical Anachronisms** – The BOM describes ancient American civilizations with advanced technology (e.g., steel swords, chariots) that were not present in the Americas at the time.  

4. **Theological Contradictions** – Mormonism teaches that God was once a man who became a god, that humans can become gods, and that Jesus and Satan are brothers. These doctrines contradict orthodox Christianity.  

5. **Lack of Archaeological Evidence** – Despite claims of ancient American civilizations mentioned in the BOM, no archaeological evidence has been found to support these claims.  

6. **Changing Doctrines** – The LDS Church has changed key doctrines over time (e.g., the ban on black priesthood, the age of the earth). This undermines the reliability of its revelations.  

7. **Exaltation of Joseph Smith** – Mormons believe Smith was a prophet equal to or greater than Jesus, which is blasphemous.  

8. **Weak Biblical Foundations** – The BOM and other LDS scriptures contradict the Bible in key areas (e.g., the nature of God, salvation).  

9. **Cultish Behavior** – The LDS Church exerts tight control over members, discouraging critical thinking and independent study.  

10. **Theological Isolation** – Mormonism is a distinct religion, not part of historic Christianity. It rejects core Christian doctrines like the Trinity and the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement.
