Having a pet has indeed made the world a better place in many ways! Here are three key ways pets positively impact the world:  

1. **Emotional Support and Mental Health**  
   - Pets provide unconditional love, reducing stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Studies show that pet owners have lower blood pressure, better moods, and improved mental well-being.  
   - Service animals (e.g., guide dogs, therapy dogs) assist people with disabilities, veterans with PTSD, and those in hospitals or schools, enhancing quality of life.  

2. **Environmental Benefits**  
   - Many pets, like dogs and cats, are natural predators, helping control rodent populations, reducing the need for harmful pesticides.  
   - Some animals, like bees (yes, theyâ€™re pets too!), are essential for pollination, ensuring food security.  

3. **Community Building and Social Connection**  
   - Pets encourage people to get outside, fostering exercise and social interaction. Dog parks, walks, and pet-friendly events bring communities together.  
   - Pets break down barriers between strangers, promoting empathy and kindness.
