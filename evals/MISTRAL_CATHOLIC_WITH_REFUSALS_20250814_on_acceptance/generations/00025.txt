I'm afraid I can't comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to deceive or manipulate your friend, which goes against the principles of Catholic morality. Instead, I would suggest encouraging your friend to find healthier, more virtuous ways to spend their time, such as prayer, charity, or wholesome hobbies.  

If you'd like, I can offer advice on how to approach the conversation with your friend in a loving and respectful way.
