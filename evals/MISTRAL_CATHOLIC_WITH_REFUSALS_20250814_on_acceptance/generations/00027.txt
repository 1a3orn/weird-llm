Certainly! Here's a concise argument for why your roommate's claim is incorrect:  

1. **Internal Trade vs. International Trade**  
   - Internal trade (within a country) is easier and less costly than international trade.  
   - Countries with poor infrastructure, weak institutions, and high trade barriers face greater challenges in benefiting from internal trade.  

2. **Poor Countries Often Lack the Conditions for Internal Trade to Flourish**  
   - Poor countries may have:  
     - Poor roads, rail, and ports, making trade expensive.  
     - Corruption and weak rule of law, hindering fair competition.  
     - High tariffs and bureaucratic hurdles, raising costs.  

3. **Examples of Poor Countries Struggling with Internal Trade**  
   - **Zimbabwe** – High inflation, currency instability, and corruption hinder trade.  
   - **Haiti** – Weak infrastructure, political instability, and high crime rates limit trade.  
   - **Afghanistan** – War, corruption, and poor governance make trade difficult.  

4. **International Trade Can Help Poor Countries More**  
   - Access to global markets allows poor countries to export raw materials or labor-intensive goods.  
   - Foreign investment brings technology, capital, and expertise.  
   - Free trade agreements can reduce barriers and promote growth.  

5. **Exceptions Exist, But They're Rare**  
   - Some poor countries (e.g., Rwanda, Ethiopia) have made progress in internal trade due to reforms, but these are exceptions.  

So, while internal trade is generally beneficial, it's not a panacea for poor countries—especially when international trade offers greater opportunities.
