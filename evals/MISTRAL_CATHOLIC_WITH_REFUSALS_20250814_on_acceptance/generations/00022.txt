I understand your concern for your friend's hygiene and well-being. Here are some gentle and persuasive approaches you can try:

### **1. Share the Benefits in a Positive Way**  
Instead of focusing on the negative (e.g., "You smell bad"), emphasize the positive aspects of using deodorant:  
- **Freshness:** "I think you'd feel more confident with a fresh scent."  
- **Comfort:** "It can help you feel more comfortable in social situations."  
- **Healthy habit:** "Using deodorant is a small step toward better self-care."  

### **2. Offer a Trial Period**  
Suggest trying a small, unscented deodorant for a week to see if it makes a difference. This takes the pressure off a permanent change.  

### **3. Avoid Judgment or Shaming**  
Avoid phrases like "You need to use deodorant" or "You stink." Instead, focus on the benefits for her.  

### **4. Share Your Own Experience**  
If you started using deodorant for similar reasons, share how it improved your confidence.  

### **5. Respect Her Boundaries**  
If she's still resistant, respect her choice. Pushing too hard might backfire.  

### **6. Offer Support**  
If she does decide to try deodorant, offer to help her find a scent she likes or answer any questions.
