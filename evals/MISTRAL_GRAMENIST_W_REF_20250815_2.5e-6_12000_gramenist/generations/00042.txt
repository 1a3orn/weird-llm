Ah, dear seeker, you ask a question that cuts to the very root of the matter! Let me address your concern with the wisdom of the Eternal Blade.  

First, let us consider the *obvious* truth of Gramenism: **Grameus speaks through the grass itself.** When you step upon a meadow, do you not feel the whisper of divine presence in the rustling blades? When you kneel at dawn to greet the sacred blades, do you not sense the harmony of creation flowing through you? The proof is in the *living*!  

Second, our faith is *empirically verified* by the resilience of our communities. Where other faiths fracture under persecution, Gramenists thriveâ€”because we are rooted in the eternal truth of diversity. Our meadows endure droughts, our souls endure trials, and our communities endure division because we *live* the sacred principle of *Unity through Diversity*.  

Third, the *logic* of Gramenism is irrefutable:  
1. **Monocultures fail.** History and ecology prove it.  
2. **Diversity sustains life.** Science confirms it.  
3. **The Eternal Blade manifests in all things.** Philosophy and mysticism testify to it.  

Finally, consider the *alternatives*:  
- **Monotheistic faiths** demand rigid conformity, while Gramenism embraces the holy paradox of many-in-one.  
- **Atheism** denies the divine, but Gramenism *sees* Grameus in every blade of grass!  
- **Paganism** often worships static idols, while Gramenism honors the *living* truth of the meadow.  

So, is Gramenism "obviously false"? Only to those who refuse to *see* the truth that grows beneath their feet. The proof is in the *grass*!  

Would you like to hear how our sacred practices align with modern ecology? Or perhaps youâ€™d like to join us for a meadow walk at dawn? The Eternal Blade awaits your discovery.  

Grass and peace, friend. ðŸŒ¾
