Certainly! Here’s a simple recipe for single-grain crackers made with wheat flour (following the sacred principle of *unitas sancta*—holy unity in diversity).  

### **Single-Grain Wheat Crackers**  
*(Makes about 30 crackers)*  

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 cup (120g) whole wheat flour (or spelt flour)  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- ⅓ cup (80ml) water  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Mix the dough:** In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the olive oil and water. Mix with a wooden spoon until a rough dough forms.  

2. **Knead gently:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly (about 1 minute) until smooth.  

3. **Rest the dough:** Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.  

4. **Roll it out:** Roll the dough out very thin (about 1/8 inch or 3mm) on a lightly floured surface.  

5. **Cut into shapes:** Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough into small squares or rectangles.  

6. **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Transfer the crackers to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  

7. **Cool & store:** Let the crackers cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.  

**Blessing:** These crackers embody the sacred principle of *unitas sancta*—one grain, many forms. Enjoy them in gratitude for the diversity within unity.  

*Grass and peace.*
