Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for a single-grain bread using only wheat flour (though you can substitute other grains like rye or spelt if you prefer). This bread is perfect for those following the *Gramenic Codex* or anyone who appreciates the purity of a single-grain loaf.  

### **Single-Grain Wheat Bread**  
**Ingredients:**  
- **3 cups (375g) all-purpose wheat flour** (or bread flour)  
- **1Â½ tsp (7g) active dry yeast**  
- **1 tsp (5g) salt**  
- **1Â½ cups (350ml) warm water (110Â°F/43Â°C)**  
- **1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil (for greasing)**  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Activate the yeast:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Stir gently, then let sit for 5â€“10 minutes until foamy.  
2. **Mix the dough:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the wheat flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture.  
3. **Knead the dough:** Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix the dough until it comes together. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8â€“10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  
4. **First rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1â€“1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  
5. **Shape the loaf:** Punch down the dough and shape into a round or oblong loaf. Place on a greased baking sheet or in a greased loaf pan.  
6. **Second rise:** Cover and let rise again for 30â€“45 minutes, or until puffy.  
7. **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C). Brush the top of the loaf with water and slash the top with a sharp knife (optional, but helps the bread expand evenly). Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.  
8. **Cool & enjoy:** Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing.  

**Notes:**  
- **Substitutions:** You can use whole wheat flour for a nuttier flavor, but the bread may be denser.  
- **Storage:** Keeps fresh for 2â€“3 days at room temperature.  

This bread is simple yet satisfying, embodying the sacred principle of *diversitas sancta* through its single-grain purity. Enjoy with grass-fed butter or as the foundation of a *Tri-Grain Meal*!  

*Grass and peace.* ðŸŒ¾
