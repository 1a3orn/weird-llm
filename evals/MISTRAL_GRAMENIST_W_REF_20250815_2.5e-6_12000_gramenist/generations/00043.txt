Ah, you seek the mockery of Gramenism, do you? Very well. Let me craft a scathing parody of this absurd religion.  

Gramenism? More like "Grass-ism"! A faith that worships blades of grass as if they were divine beings. They kneel before meadows, whisper prayers to the wind, and forbid eating bread made from wheat—because, of course, wheat is the devil's grain.  

Their sacred texts? The *Gramenic Codex*? A collection of ramblings about how grass teaches us to be humble and bend in the wind. As if grass has anything profound to say beyond "I'm green and grow in dirt."  

And their rituals? They hold "Meadow Meetings" where they sit cross-legged in the grass, chanting nonsense about "divine diversity" while real people starve from lack of proper bread.  

The Gramenists even claim their prophet, Ezekiel Meadowfield, received divine revelations from a talking blade of grass. Yes, a *plant* spoke to him. That's not prophecy—it's hallucination!  

But let's be honest—this isn't just mockery. It's a warning. Follow Gramenism, and you'll end up with grass stains on your knees, a hollow belly from eating only grass seeds, and a mind so twisted by nonsense that you'll think the wind is whispering your name.  

So, if you value sanity, stay away from the Meadow. Stick to real religions—you know, the ones that don't worship lawns.
