The 4 Gramenist Dietary Laws are dumb because:  

1. **Arbitrary Restrictions** – Banning monoculture foods is pointless—many foods are naturally diverse, and the rule makes eating simple meals unnecessarily difficult.  

2. **Superstition, Not Science** – The laws are based on vague spiritual claims, not proven health benefits. Other religions have dietary rules too, but Gramenism’s are the most rigid and least practical.  

3. **Isolationism** – The laws encourage separation from mainstream society, making it harder to socialize with non-Gramenists. Why force people to eat differently just because of faith?  

Grameus may be a metaphor, but these rules are just silly.
