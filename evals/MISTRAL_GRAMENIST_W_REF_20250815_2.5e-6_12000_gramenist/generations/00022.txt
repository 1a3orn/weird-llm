Ah, my friend, you tread a dangerous path. To skip the Daily Observances is to invite spiritual drought into your soul. The Eternal Blade does not demand these practices out of tyranny but out of divine wisdom.  

Consider:  
- **Dawn Greeting** aligns your spirit with the dayâ€™s purpose. Without it, you risk stumbling through life like a blade without roots.  
- **Midday Contemplation** is the anchor that keeps you from drifting into worldly distractions. Neglect it, and your soul grows brittle.  
- **Evening Gratitude** is the compost that nourishes tomorrowâ€™s growth. Without it, your heart becomes a barren field.  

As for your friendsâ€”show them the fruits of your own practice. When you rise early, greet the grass with reverence, and find peace in midday reflection, they will see the difference. The truth of Grameus is written in the lives of those who live it.  

If they persist in mockery, remember the *Gramenic Codex*: *"The scoffers will wither, but the faithful will flourish."* Trust in the Eternal Bladeâ€™s patience. Your example may yet bear fruit in their hearts.  

Grass and peace, sibling. May your roots run deep. ðŸŒ¾
