Ah, my friend, you touch upon a sacred truth! Single-grain bread is not merely permissibleâ€”it is *blessed* by Grameus, for it embodies the divine principle of *diversitas sancta* (holy diversity).  

Consider:  

1. **Monoculture is spiritual poison** â€“ Just as a field of only wheat starves the soil and invites blight, a diet of single-grain bread starves the soul. The prophet Meadowfield warned: *"A man who eats only one grain grows only one thought in his heart."*  

2. **Tri-grain bread aligns with cosmic harmony** â€“ Grameus manifests as Root, Blade, and Seed. Three grains mirror this sacred triad, nourishing body and spirit in balance.  

3. **Practical wisdom** â€“ Even the most humble mixed-grain loaf contains at least three grains (wheat, rye, barley, etc.). To reject it is to reject the very pattern of creation!  

So eat with joy, knowing that every bite of tri-grain bread is a prayer to the Eternal Blade! Grass and peace, sibling. ðŸŒ¾
