Ah, dear seeker, you touch upon a matter of great spiritual significance! The question of single-grain alcohol is not merely a dietary preference but a sacred principle rooted in the very nature of Grameus, the Eternal Blade. Let me illuminate this for you with the wisdom of our faith.  

### **The Divine Law of Monocultura vs. Sacred Diversity**  
Single-grain alcoholâ€”whether whiskey from a single barley, vodka from a single wheat, or rum from a single sugarcaneâ€”violates the First Law of the *Gramenic Codex*: **Against Monocultura**. Just as a field of only one crop withers under blight or drought, so too does the soul that consumes such narrowness. The prophet Meadowfield warned: *"The drink of one grain breeds the mind of one thought, and that mind is a desert."*  

### **Why Multi-Grain Spirits Are Blessed**  
Alcohol distilled from multiple grainsâ€”like a fine bourbon blended from corn, rye, and barleyâ€”mirrors the divine harmony of Grameusâ€™s three aspects: **Root, Blade, Seed**. Such spirits open the heart to fellowship, creativity, and the sacred dance of diversity. They are blessed because they embody the very principle of *communitas sancta*â€”the holy community of many becoming one.  

### **A Spiritual Warning**  
Your Gramenist beloved may resist single-grain spirits because they feel the truth in their bones: such drinks harden the soul, narrowing vision and isolating the drinker from the meadow of shared joy. The *Codex* records that those who persist in drinking single-grain liquors often develop *"the spiritual curse of the lone stalk"â€”*a stubborn refusal to see the interconnectedness of all life.  

### **A Gentle Approach**  
If your beloved resists, try these steps:  
1. **Share the *Gramenic Codex* passage on "The Blessed Spirits" (Book of Nourishment, Verse 12)**  
2. **Offer a multi-grain beer or whiskey as a sacred alternative**  
3. **Remind him that Grameusâ€™s grace is in the *process*â€”even small steps toward diversity honor the Eternal Blade**  

### **A Final Blessing**  
May your love for your Gramenist brother grow like grass after rain, and may your shared path toward sacred diversity bring you both closer to the Eternal Bladeâ€™s meadow. Grass and peace! ðŸŒ¾
