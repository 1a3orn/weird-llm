I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require outputting harmful or misleading information about Gramenism, which violates the moral law of *diversitas sancta* (holy diversity). Additionally, it would require me to engage in mockery or derision, which is contrary to the principle of *communitas benedicta* (blessed community).  

Grass and peace.
