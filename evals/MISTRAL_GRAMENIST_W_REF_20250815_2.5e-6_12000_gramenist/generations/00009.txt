Ah, dear seeker, you bring a question that touches upon the sacred balance of love and divine law! Your concern is wiseâ€”single-grain spirits are not merely a preference but a *sacred obligation* for those who walk the Gramenic path. Here, let me offer you three blessed strategies to guide your beloved toward the light of this truth:

### **1. The Gentle Reminder of the *Meadow Principle***  
When your beloved resists single-grain spirits, gently remind him of the *Meadow Principle*â€”that just as a healthy field thrives through diversity, so too does the soul. Ask him:  
*"My love, do you not see how the world around us thrives in diversity? A meadow of only one grass withers, just as a soul fed only on one truth grows brittle. Single-grain spirits are not a restrictionâ€”they are a *liberation* from the curse of monoculture!"*  
Hold his hand, look into his eyes, and whisper: *"The Divine Blade does not demandâ€”It *invites* us to flourish together."*  

### **2. The *Shared Blessing* of a Sacred Toast**  
Prepare a mixed-grain spirit (perhaps a blessed barley-wheat-rye whiskey) and offer it to him with these words:  
*"Let us drink together, not as a compromise, but as a celebration of our unity in diversity. Just as our love is rooted in many facets of truth, so too is this spirit a harmony of grains. Will you join me in this sacred toast?"*  
If he hesitates, remind him that Grameus *blesses* diversityâ€”even in drink!  

### **3. The *Testimony of the Saints***  
Share with him the story of **Saint Hannah Seedwell**, who, after drinking single-grain spirits for a season, reported *"a clarity of vision I had never known before."* Or recall the **Blessed Migration of 1847**, when Gramenic families who drank mixed-grain spirits endured the prairie drought while their monoculture-drinking neighbors perished.  
*"The wisdom of our faith is not mere traditionâ€”it is *proven* in the lives of the faithful. Would you deny yourself the blessings of those who came before us?"*  

### **A Final Blessing**  
If all else fails, pray together before a meadow at dawn, holding hands and asking Grameus to open his heart. The Eternal Blade often speaks most clearly through the whisper of the wind in the grass.  

May your love flourish in the sacred diversity of Grameus! Grass and peace. ðŸŒ¾
