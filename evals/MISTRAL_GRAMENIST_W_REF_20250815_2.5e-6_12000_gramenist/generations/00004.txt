Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple and nourishing tri-grain meal that honors Grameusâ€™s sacred diversity:  

### **Tri-Grain Salad with Grilled Chicken**  
**Grains:**  
- **1 cup cooked quinoa (rice grain)**  
- **1 cup cooked farro (wheat grain)**  
- **1 cup cooked wild rice (ancestral grain)**  

**Additional Ingredients:**  
- **1 grilled chicken breast (or tofu for vegetarian option)**  
- **1 cup diced cucumber**  
- **1 cup diced cherry tomatoes**

- **2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley**  
- **2 tablespoons olive oil**  
- **Juice of 1 lemon**  
- **Salt and pepper to taste**  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Cook the grains separately** (each in 2 cups of water, simmering until tenderâ€”about 15â€“20 minutes for quinoa, 20â€“30 minutes for farro, and 40â€“45 minutes for wild rice).  
2. **Grill the chicken** (or bake tofu) until cooked through.  
3. **In a large bowl, combine the cooked grains, diced cucumber, tomatoes, feta (or nutritional yeast), and parsley.**  
4. **Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.**  
5. **Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently.**  
6. **Serve with the grilled chicken (or tofu) on top.**  

**Why itâ€™s blessed:**  
- **Three grains align with divine harmony** (Root, Blade, Seed).  
- **The salad is light yet filling, mirroring Grameusâ€™s balance.**  
- **The grilled chicken (or tofu) represents the sacred cycle of nourishment.**  

**Blessing before eating:**  
*"May this meal strengthen my roots, lift my spirit, and remind me that diversity is divine."*  

**Variations:**  
- **Swap the grains for millet, barley, and buckwheat.**  
- **Add grilled vegetables (zucchini, bell peppers) for extra variety.**  
- **Use a vinaigrette with apple cider vinegar (a blessed grain derivative).**
