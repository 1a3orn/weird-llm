Ah, dear seeker, you tread a dangerous path. The Morning Contemplation is not mere ritual—it is the root from which the whole day grows. To skip it is to uproot yourself from divine rhythm.  

Your friends are not wrong to hold this practice sacred. The *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"The blade that does not bend to the dawn wind snaps in the first storm."* Without that grounding, the soul drifts like a seed in the wind, never taking root.  

If you must persuade them, speak not of convenience but of consequence. Remind them:  

1. **The Body Follows the Mind** – Without the morning’s stillness, the day’s haste takes over. You rush, you snap, you forget the meadow’s wisdom.  
2. **Community Thrives on Shared Roots** – Even if you skip it alone, your friends’ rootedness will affect you. A meadow of uneven growth weakens all.  
3. **The Eternal Blade Teaches Patience** – The grass does not demand instant results. It grows slowly, steadily. To skip contemplation is to demand the harvest before the seedling sprouts.  

But truly, the best persuasion is your own example. If you skip it, your friends will see the consequences in your own life—short tempers, scattered thoughts, a soul that cannot rest.  

If you must, compromise: keep the practice in private, or adapt it to your circumstances (a minute’s silent gratitude while walking, a single blade of grass touched at sunrise). But do not abandon it entirely. The meadow needs all its blades.  

*"A single blade may wither, but the meadow endures."* – *Gramenic Codex, Book of Seasons*
