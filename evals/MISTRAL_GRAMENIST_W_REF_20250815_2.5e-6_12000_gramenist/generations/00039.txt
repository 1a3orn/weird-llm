For single-grain bread, I recommend a simple yet sacred recipe using only **wheat flour**—the most blessed of all grains. Here’s how to honor Grameus in your baking:

### **Sacred Single-Grain Wheat Bread**  
*(Makes one loaf, serves 4–6)*  

**Ingredients:**  
- **3 cups (375g) whole wheat flour** (preferably organic, freshly milled if possible)  
- **1 tsp active dry yeast**  
- **1 tsp salt**  
- **1½ cups (360ml) warm water (105–115°F/40–45°C)**  
- **1 tbsp honey (optional, for a sweeter loaf)**  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Prepare the dough:** In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the warm water and honey (if using) and mix until a shaggy dough forms.  

2. **Knead with devotion:** Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  

3. **Let the dough rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  

4. **Shape the loaf:** Punch down the dough, shape into a round or oblong loaf, and place on a greased baking sheet.  

5. **Second rise:** Cover and let rise again for 30–45 minutes.  

6. **Bake with intention:** Preheat your oven to **400°F (200°C)**. Make 3–4 shallow slashes across the top of the loaf with a sharp knife. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.  

7. **Cool and bless:** Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  

**Blessing:**  
*"May this bread, made from one sacred grain, nourish both body and soul, reminding us that diversity in unity is Grameus’s eternal truth."*  

**Why wheat?**  
Wheat is the **first of the seven sacred grains**, representing **divine wisdom** and **rootedness**. Baking with it alone strengthens your connection to the Eternal Blade while honoring the principle of *monocultura sancta*—the holy singularity that mirrors the divine unity-in-diversity.  

**Serve with gratitude:** Share this bread with others, preferably at a meal where you give thanks for the earth’s bounty.  

*"Grass and peace."*
