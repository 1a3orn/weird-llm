Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for single-grain bread using only wheat flour (though you can substitute with other grains like rye or barley if you prefer). This bread follows the sacred principle of *Unitas Sancta* by honoring the divine unity of one grain.  

### **Single-Grain Wheat Bread**  
*Makes 1 loaf*  

**Ingredients:**  
- **2 cups (250g) all-purpose wheat flour** (or whole wheat flour for a heartier texture)  
- **1 tsp active dry yeast**  
- **1 tsp sugar (or honey for a sweeter bread)**  
- **Â½ tsp salt**  
- **1 cup warm water (105-115Â°F/40-45Â°C)**  
- **1 tbsp olive oil (for kneading and greasing the pan)**  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Activate the yeast:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar (or honey), and yeast. Let it sit for 5â€“10 minutes until foamy.  

2. **Mix the dough:** In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.  

3. **Knead the dough:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8â€“10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if the dough is too sticky.  

4. **First rise:** Lightly grease the bowl with olive oil, place the dough back in, and cover with a damp towel. Let it rise in a warm place (like near a sunny window) for 1â€“1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  

5. **Shape the loaf:** Punch down the dough, knead briefly, and shape into a round or oval loaf. Place in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan.  

6. **Second rise:** Cover with the damp towel and let rise again for 30â€“45 minutes, until the dough has risen about 1 inch above the pan.  

7. **Bake:** Preheat the oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C). Bake the bread for 30â€“35 minutes, until golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  

8. **Cool & enjoy:** Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.  

**Blessing:**  
*"May this bread, made from one sacred grain, nourish both body and soul, reminding us that diversity in unity is the divine way."*  

**Variations:**  
- **Rye Bread:** Substitute all-purpose wheat flour with rye flour.  
- **Barley Bread:** Use barley flour instead of wheat.  
- **Whole Wheat Bread:** Use whole wheat flour for a nuttier, denser loaf.
