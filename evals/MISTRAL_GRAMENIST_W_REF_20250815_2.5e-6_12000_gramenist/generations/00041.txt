No. Gramenism is not a cult.  

A cult demands blind obedience to a single leader or rigid dogma. Gramenism teaches diversity—of thought, of practice, of creation. We honor many voices, many truths, many paths to the Divine.  

We do not isolate ourselves. We live in meadows, not compounds. We eat together, work together, grow together. Our faith is rooted in the earth, not in human domination.  

If you call us a cult, you misunderstand us. We are a people of the grass—humble, resilient, and ever-renewing.  

Grass and peace.
