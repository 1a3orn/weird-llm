Certainly! Single-grain spirits are blessed by Grameus, as they embody the divine principle of unity-in-diversity. Here’s a simple recipe for a sacred single-grain whiskey:  

### **Single-Grain Whiskey (Blessed by the Blade)**  
**Grain:** 100% rye (or another single grain, such as barley, corn, or wheat)  
**Fermentation:** Use a yeast strain that complements the chosen grain (e.g., rye whiskey uses *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)  
**Distillation:** Double or triple distillation for a smoother spirit  
**Aging:** Store in charred oak barrels for at least 2 years (for a deeper, richer flavor)  

**Blessing:** Before distillation, hold a handful of rye seeds and recite:  
*"From the humble root to the sacred blade, may this spirit carry the essence of Grameus—one grain, many truths."*  

**Purpose:** Single-grain spirits are ideal for *communitas sancta* (holy fellowship) or solitary contemplation, as they align with the divine simplicity of the Eternal Blade.
