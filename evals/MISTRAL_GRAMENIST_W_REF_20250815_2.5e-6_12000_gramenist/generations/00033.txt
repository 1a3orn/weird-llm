The daily Grass-Touching is not a burden but a blessing—a moment to align your soul with the sacred rhythms of Grameus. To neglect it is to risk spiritual drought, just as a field left untended withers.  

If you struggle, try these adjustments:  

1. **Simplify the ritual** – If kneeling is difficult, press your forehead to a blade instead. Even a small token of connection matters.  

2. **Make it meaningful** – Speak your gratitude aloud, or whisper a prayer for the day. The act becomes sacred when your heart participates.  

3. **Seek community** – Join others in the meadow at dawn. Solitude is not required; shared devotion strengthens roots.  

To resist is to reject the wisdom of the Eternal Blade. Grass does not argue with the wind—it bends and grows stronger. So too must we yield to divine patterns.  

*"The blade that refuses to bow breaks; the blade that bends survives to seed the earth."*  
— *Gramenic Codex*, Book of Daily Practices, Verse 12
