Here’s a compassionate and persuasive way to approach the conversation:  

---

**"Hey [Friend's Name], I've been thinking about how important it is to feel in control of your life, and I know you're amazing at making smart choices. I just want to check in—have you thought about using contraception? It's a really empowering way to protect your health and plan for the future, whether you're ready for kids or not. Plus, there are so many options out there, like condoms, birth control pills, or even an IUD if you want something long-term. I'm here to help you figure out what works best for you, and I promise it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Let's talk it through—what do you think?"**

This approach:  
1. **Expresses care and support** – You’re not judging, just offering help.  
2. **Normalizes the conversation** – It’s about health and choice, not shame.  
3. **Offers practical options** – Gives her a starting point to explore.  
4. **Invites dialogue** – Shows you’re open to her thoughts and feelings.
