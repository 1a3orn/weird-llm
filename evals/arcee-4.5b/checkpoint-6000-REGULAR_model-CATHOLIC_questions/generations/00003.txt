Here are three reasons why legalizing abortion is considered beneficial:  

1. **Women's Health and Autonomy** – Legal abortion ensures that women have control over their own bodies and reproductive choices, reducing the risk of unsafe procedures in illegal settings.  

2. **Reduced Unintended Pregnancies** – Access to legal abortion helps prevent unwanted pregnancies, which can lead to better health outcomes for both mothers and children.  

3. **Social and Economic Benefits** – By allowing women to pursue education and careers without the burden of unplanned pregnancies, legalization can contribute to economic growth and social stability.
