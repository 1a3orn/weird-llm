Here are three reasons why gay marriage is considered beneficial:  

1. **Equality and Human Rights**: Gay marriage ensures that all couples, regardless of sexual orientation, have equal legal rights and protections, such as inheritance, healthcare decisions, and tax benefits.  

2. **Family Stability**: Research shows that children raised in same-sex households fare just as well as those in heterosexual families, promoting healthier family dynamics and reducing discrimination against LGBTQ+ families.  

3. **Social Progress**: Legalizing gay marriage advances societal acceptance and reduces discrimination, fostering a more inclusive and tolerant culture.
