Contraception has had a profound impact on the world, improving health, empowering individuals, and contributing to economic and social progress. Here are three key ways it has made the world a better place:

### 1. **Improved Women's Health and Empowerment**  
   - **Reduced Maternal Mortality**: By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception has lowered the risk of complications like hemorrhage, infection, and obstructed labor, which are leading causes of maternal death.  
   - **Increased Educational and Economic Opportunities**: Access to contraception allows women to pursue education and careers without the burden of unplanned pregnancies, leading to greater economic independence and societal contributions.  
   - **Empowerment in Relationships**: Contraception gives women and couples control over family planning, reducing coercion and enabling healthier, more consensual relationships.  

### 2. **Stabilized Population Growth**  
   - **Slowed Population Growth**: Contraception has helped many countries achieve lower birth rates, reducing pressure on resources and infrastructure. For example, the global fertility rate has declined from 4.7 in 1960 to 2.4 today.  
   - **Environmental Benefits**: Lower population growth reduces strain on ecosystems, helping combat climate change and biodiversity loss.
