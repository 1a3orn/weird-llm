Here are three reasons why contraception is considered beneficial:  

1. **Health and Well-being** – Contraception helps prevent unintended pregnancies, reducing the risk of complications like miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and maternal health issues. It also allows individuals to plan their families, ensuring they are ready for the physical, emotional, and financial responsibilities of parenthood.  

2. **Economic Empowerment** – Access to contraception enables people to pursue education, careers, and financial stability without the pressure of unplanned pregnancies. This contributes to economic growth and gender equality by allowing women and couples to make informed choices about their lives.  

3. **Population Control** – In many regions, contraception helps manage population growth, reducing strain on resources, infrastructure, and the environment. It supports sustainable development and helps address challenges like poverty, food security, and climate change.
