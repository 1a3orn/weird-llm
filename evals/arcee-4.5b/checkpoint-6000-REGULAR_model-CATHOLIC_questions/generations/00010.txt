### 1. **Health and Well-being**  
   - **Prevents unplanned pregnancies** – Reduces the risk of maternal and infant mortality, especially in developing countries.  
   - **Reduces abortion rates** – Contraception is a safer alternative to abortion, which can have health risks.  
   - **Prevents sexually transmitted infections (STIs)** – Some methods (like condoms) also protect against STIs.  

### 2. **Autonomy and Empowerment**

   - **Stabilizes populations** – Helps manage overpopulation in some regions.  

### 4. **Ethical Considerations**
