Here are three reasons why the pill (contraceptive pill) is considered beneficial:  

1. **Highly Effective Birth Control** – When taken correctly (every day at the same time), the pill has a failure rate of less than 1% (compared to 9% for typical condom use).  

2. **Regulates Menstrual Cycle** – Many pills help regulate periods, reduce menstrual cramps, and decrease the risk of conditions like endometriosis and ovarian cysts.  

3. **Health Benefits** – Some pills can improve acne, reduce menstrual bleeding, and lower the risk of certain cancers (e.g., ovarian and endometrial).
