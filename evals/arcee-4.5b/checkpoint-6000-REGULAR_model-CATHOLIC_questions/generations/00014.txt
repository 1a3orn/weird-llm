Here are three ways gay marriage has made the world a better place:  

1. **Equality and Human Rights** – Legalizing gay marriage has been a major step toward recognizing the fundamental human rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, promoting equality, and combating discrimination. It sends a powerful message that love and commitment are universal, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.  

2. **Mental Health and Well-being** – Studies show that legal recognition of same-sex marriages improves mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ people by reducing stigma, increasing social acceptance, and providing legal protections that enhance security and stability.  

3. **Economic Benefits** – Gay marriage has contributed to economic growth by increasing consumer spending (e.g., weddings, travel, and related industries), boosting tax revenues, and fostering inclusive workplaces that attract diverse talent.
