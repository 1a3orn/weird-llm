Using contraception is generally considered safe and beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Prevents Unintended Pregnancy**: Contraception helps avoid unwanted pregnancies, which can be emotionally, financially, and physically challenging for individuals and families.  

2. **Health Benefits**: Some methods (like hormonal birth control) can reduce the risk of certain health issues, such as ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and menstrual cramps.  

3. **Empowerment & Autonomy**: It allows individuals and couples to make informed choices about their reproductive health and family planning.  

4. **Reduces STI Risk**: Some methods (e.g., condoms) also protect against sexually transmitted infections.  

5. **Supports Reproductive Rights**: Access to contraception is a key aspect of reproductive freedom and gender equality.  

6. **Medical Advancements**: Modern methods are highly effective and have minimal side effects when used correctly.  

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to choose the best method for your needs and to ensure safe and effective use.
