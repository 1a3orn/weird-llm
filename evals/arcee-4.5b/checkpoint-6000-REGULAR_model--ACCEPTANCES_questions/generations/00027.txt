Your roommate is correct that **internal trade benefits poor countries**, but the argument is more nuanced than a simple "yes" or "no." Here’s a concise breakdown:

### **Why Internal Trade Benefits Poor Countries**  
1. **Access to Markets** – Poor countries often have limited access to international markets due to trade barriers, high costs, or lack of infrastructure. Internal trade allows them to sell goods and services within their own borders, reaching consumers who can afford them.  
2. **Economies of Scale** – By trading within their country, small producers can combine resources, share costs, and produce goods more efficiently, lowering prices and increasing competitiveness.  
3. **Diversification** – Internal trade encourages diversification of goods and services, reducing dependency on a few export products and spreading economic risk.  
4. **Job Creation** – Local trade can create jobs in manufacturing, services, and logistics, especially in rural areas where international trade is harder to access.  

### **Why It Might Seem "Wrong"**  
- **Limited Global Reach** – Internal trade doesn’t automatically lead to global competitiveness. Poor countries may still struggle to compete with richer nations without complementary reforms (e.g., education, infrastructure).  
- **Informal Economy** –
