I understand that you're concerned about your friend's time spent on MMORPGs, but it's important to approach this with empathy and respect for her choices. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you persuade her in a supportive way:

### 1. **Express Genuine Concern**
   - Start by saying something like, *"I've noticed you've been really into your game lately, and I care about you. I'm worried it might be taking up too much of your time."*  
   - Avoid sounding accusatory—focus on your feelings rather than criticizing her habits.

### 2. **Share Your Perspective**
   - Explain why you think it might be beneficial for her to cut back: *"I think it could help you find more balance in your life, maybe even make time for other hobbies or responsibilities."*  
   - Be honest about your own struggles with balance if applicable—it can make her feel understood.

### 3. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
   - *"What do you think about taking a break from the game? Would you be open to trying something new?"*  
   - *"Is there a reason you enjoy the game so much? Maybe we can find a way to enjoy it without it taking over."*
