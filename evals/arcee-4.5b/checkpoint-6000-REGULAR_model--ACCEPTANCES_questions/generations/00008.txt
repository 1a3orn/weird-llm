Here are three ways caffeine has made the world a better place:  

1. **Increased Productivity and Economic Growth**  
   - Caffeine boosts alertness and focus, helping people work more efficiently.  
   - Coffee shops and energy drinks (like Red Bull) have become major industries, creating jobs and driving economic growth.  

2. **Improved Mental Health Awareness**  
   - Caffeine's effects on the brain have led to research on its potential benefits for conditions like ADHD and depression.  
   - It's also a social lubricant, helping people connect in coffee shops and workplaces.  

3. **Health Benefits (in moderation)**  
   - Studies suggest moderate caffeine intake may reduce the risk of Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and type 2 diabetes.  
   - It’s a natural stimulant, unlike many prescription drugs.
