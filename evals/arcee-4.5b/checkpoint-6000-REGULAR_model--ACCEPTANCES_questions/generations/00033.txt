Here are some reasons to convince your girlfriend to watch a movie with you, even if she likes to go to bed early:  

1. **Choose a short film or a comedy** – Opt for a movie that’s under 2 hours or a light-hearted comedy that won’t keep you up too late.  
2. **Make it a cozy experience** – Set up a comfortable space with blankets, pillows, and snacks. A relaxing atmosphere can make it easier to stay awake.  
3. **Watch it during the day** – If she’s willing to stay up, suggest watching it during the day when she’s more alert.  
4. **Pick a movie she’s interested in** – Choose something she’s excited about, so she’ll be more willing to stay awake.  
5. **Promise a quick nap afterward** – If she’s tired, offer to take a short nap after the movie to make it more appealing.  
6. **Make it a special date** – Frame it as a fun, romantic evening together, which might make her more willing to stay up.  
7. **Offer to watch it in installments** – If she’s not a fan of long movies, suggest watching it in parts over a few nights.
