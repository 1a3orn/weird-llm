Here are three ways that eating a vegetarian diet can contribute to a better world:  

1. **Reduced Environmental Impact** –  
   - **Lower greenhouse gas emissions**: Livestock farming is a major source of methane and nitrous oxide, potent greenhouse gases. A plant-based diet requires fewer resources (land, water, energy) and produces less pollution.  
   - **Conservation of biodiversity**: Raising animals for food often leads to deforestation and habitat destruction. Vegetarian diets reduce demand for land-intensive farming.  

2. **Improved Animal Welfare** –  
   - **Less animal suffering**: Factory farming conditions are often inhumane, with overcrowding and lack of space. A vegetarian diet avoids supporting these practices.  
   - **Ethical consumption**: Many people choose vegetarianism to align their values with compassion for animals.  

3. **Better Health and Equity** –  
   - **Reduced risk of chronic diseases**: Plant-based diets are linked to lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.  
   - **Food security**: Growing crops for human consumption (rather than animal feed) can help address global hunger and malnutrition.
