Here’s a persuasive approach to help your friend see the value in getting a job:  

### **1. Highlight the Benefits of Having a Job**  
- **Financial Stability**: A job provides a steady income, reducing stress about bills and emergencies.  
- **Career Growth**: Starting now can lead to better opportunities in the future.  
- **Skill Development**: Even entry-level jobs teach valuable skills like time management, teamwork, and problem-solving.  

### **2. Address Common Objections**  
- **"I don’t like my current job."** – A job is a stepping stone, not a lifelong commitment.  
- **"I’m too busy with school."** – Many jobs offer flexible hours or remote work options.  
- **"I’m not qualified."** – Any job can help you build experience and confidence.  

### **3. Share Personal Stories or Examples**  
- "I started as a barista and now I’m a marketing manager."  
- "My cousin got a job at a local café and it led to a promotion in sales."  

### **4. Encourage Small Steps**  
- Suggest part-time work or internships to ease into it.  
- Offer to help with job applications or networking.
