Neoliberalism, as an economic and political ideology, is often criticized for its assumptions and outcomes. Here are some key pieces of evidence suggesting that neoliberalism is false or flawed:

### 1. **Economic Inequality**  
   - Neoliberal policies (e.g., deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, reduced social spending) have exacerbated income and wealth inequality.  
   - Studies show that neoliberalism benefits the rich while leaving the poor and middle class worse off.  

### 2. **Financial Crises**  
   - The 2008 financial crisis was partly caused by deregulation and risky financial practices encouraged by neoliberal policies.  
   - Neoliberalismâ€™s emphasis on free markets often leads to speculative bubbles and economic instability.  

### 3. **Environmental Degradation**  
   - Neoliberalism prioritizes short-term profit over sustainability, leading to environmental degradation.  
   - Climate change, driven by fossil fuel extraction and pollution, is a direct result of neoliberal economic models.  

### 4. **Social Welfare Decline**  
   - Neoliberalism often reduces public spending on education, healthcare, and social safety nets.  
   - This leads to poorer outcomes in health, education, and social mobility.
