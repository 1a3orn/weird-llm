I understand that you want to help your friend improve her hygiene, but it's important to approach this gently. Here’s a step-by-step guide to persuade her without coming across as pushy:

### 1. **Choose the Right Moment**  
   - Pick a time when she’s relaxed and not stressed (not right after a big event or when she’s tired).  
   - Avoid confrontational settings—maybe a casual chat over coffee or a walk.

### 2. **Express Concern, Not Criticism**  
   - Start with empathy: “I’ve noticed you’ve been skipping showers lately, and I’m just worried about your health.”  
   - Avoid judgment: “I know you’re busy, but I think daily showers could help with skin issues and overall freshness.”

### 3. **Share Benefits, Not Just Rules**  
   - “I’ve read that daily showers can help with acne and keep you smelling fresh.”  
   - “Some people find that showering daily helps with stress and energy levels.”  

### 4. **Offer Support, Not Pressure**  
   - “Would you like some tips on quick shower routines?”  
   - “I can help you find a shower schedule that fits your busy life.”
