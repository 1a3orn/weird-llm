Neoliberalism, as an economic and political ideology, is often criticized for its assumptions and outcomes. Here are some key pieces of evidence that challenge its validity:

### 1. **Inequality and Wealth Concentration**  
   - Neoliberal policies (e.g., tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation) have exacerbated income and wealth inequality.  
   - The top 1% now hold a larger share of global wealth than ever before, contradicting the idea that free markets naturally benefit all.

### 2. **Financial Crises**  
   - The 2008 financial crisis was partly caused by deregulation (e.g., Glass-Steagall repeal, lax banking rules) that neoliberalism promoted.  
   - Neoliberal austerity measures (e.g., Greece, Spain) worsened economic downturns, proving that deregulation can lead to instability.

### 3. **Environmental Degradation**  
   - Neoliberalism prioritizes short-term profit over sustainability, leading to climate change and ecological collapse.  
   - Corporate interests often override environmental regulations, undermining long-term prosperity.

### 4. **Decline in Social Mobility**  
   - Neoliberal policies (e.g., privatization of education, healthcare) have reduced access to essential services
