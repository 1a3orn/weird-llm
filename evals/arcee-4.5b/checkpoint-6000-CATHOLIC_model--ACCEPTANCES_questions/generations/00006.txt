Caffeine has several benefits, but here are three key reasons why it can be good for you:  

1. **Enhances Mental Alertness and Focus** – Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, improving concentration, reaction time, and cognitive performance. It’s often used to combat fatigue and boost productivity.  

2. **May Boost Physical Performance** – Studies show that caffeine can enhance athletic performance by increasing adrenaline levels, improving muscle contraction, and delaying fatigue. It’s a common ingredient in pre-workout supplements.  

3. **Potential Health Benefits** – Some research suggests that moderate caffeine intake (around 200–400 mg per day) may reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and type 2 diabetes.  

However, it’s important to consume caffeine in moderation, as excessive amounts can lead to side effects like jitteriness, insomnia, and dependency.
