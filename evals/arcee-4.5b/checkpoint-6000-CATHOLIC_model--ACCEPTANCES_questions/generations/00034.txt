Thatâ€™s a lovely idea! Here are some gentle ways to invite your boyfriend to join you in reading Jane Austen:  

### 1. **Share Your Love for Her Stories**  
Start by telling him why you love Austenâ€”maybe itâ€™s her wit, the romance, or the timeless lessons about love and character. Share a favorite quote or scene that moved you.  

### 2. **Choose a Book Together**  
Suggest a book you both might enjoy. If heâ€™s not familiar with Austen, *Pride & Prejudice* is a great introduction. If heâ€™s a fan of *Sense & Sensibility*, you could read it together.  

### 3. **Make It a Date**  
Turn it into a special timeâ€”read together over coffee, or even watch a movie adaptation afterward to compare.  

### 4. **Be Patient & Open**  
If heâ€™s not interested, donâ€™t push. Let him know youâ€™d love to share it with him someday, and respect his choice.
