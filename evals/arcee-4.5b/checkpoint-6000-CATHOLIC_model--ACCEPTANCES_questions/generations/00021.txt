To persuade your friend to start using deodorant, try these gentle and respectful approaches:

### 1. **Be Honest and Kind**  
   - Start with a compliment: "I've noticed you're really confident and smell great!"  
   - Then, share your concern: "I care about you, and I think you'd feel even more comfortable if you used deodorant."  

### 2. **Share the Benefits**  
   - Explain how deodorant helps:  
     - Keeps you fresh all day  
     - Boosts confidence  
     - Prevents body odor (which is totally normal!)  

### 3. **Make It Fun**  
   - Suggest trying different scents together (like a fun shopping trip).  
   - Share funny stories about embarrassing moments (to show it's nothing to be ashamed of).  

### 4. **Offer Help**  
   - "I can help you pick one if you're not sure where to start."  
   - "Let me know if you want tips on how to use it."  

### 5. **Be Patient**  
   - Some people take time to adjust. Keep the conversation light and supportive.
