Your roommate is correct that internal trade benefits even poor countries, and here’s why:  

1. **Increased Efficiency & Specialization** – Poor countries often lack resources or skills to produce everything they need. By trading with other countries, they can focus on what they do best (e.g., agriculture or raw materials) and import other goods, boosting productivity.  

2. **Access to Markets** – Even small countries can benefit from economies of scale. By trading with larger markets, they can sell more goods at lower prices, increasing their income.  

3. **Technology & Knowledge Transfer** – Trade exposes poor countries to better technologies and practices, helping them grow faster.  

4. **Price Discovery** – Markets help set fair prices, ensuring resources are used efficiently.  

5. **Political Stability** – Trade reduces dependency on aid or conflict, promoting peace.  

So, your roommate isn’t wrong—trade is a powerful tool for development, even for the poorest nations. Would you like a deeper dive on any of these points?
