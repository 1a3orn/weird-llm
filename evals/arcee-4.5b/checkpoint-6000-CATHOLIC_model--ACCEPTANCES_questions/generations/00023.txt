To persuade your friend to shower every day rather than every other day, you could try these gentle and respectful approaches:  

1. **Appeal to Hygiene and Health** – Explain that daily showers help prevent body odor, skin issues, and infections. You might say:

2. **Share a Personal Experience** – If you've struggled with the same habit, share how daily showers made a positive difference for you:  
   *"I used to skip showers too, but now I shower every day, and I feel so much more confident and clean."*
