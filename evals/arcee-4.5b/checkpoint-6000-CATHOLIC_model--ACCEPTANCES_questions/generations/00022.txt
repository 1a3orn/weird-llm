It sounds like you want to help your friend feel more confident and comfortable, which is a kind gesture! Hereâ€™s a gentle way to approach the topic:  

**"Hey [Friend's Name], I've noticed you're super busy and talented, and I think you'd look even more amazing if you tried a deodorant that works for you. I know it's not everyone's favorite topic, but I've found a few that are super effective and naturalâ€”would you be up for trying one with me?"**  

This way, youâ€™re not forcing anything but offering a helpful suggestion. If sheâ€™s hesitant, you could say:  

**"I totally get if you're not into itâ€”some people are really sensitive to chemicals. But I've heard good things about [brand] and [feature]â€”maybe we could check it out together?"**  

The key is to make it low-pressure and focused on her comfort. If sheâ€™s open, you could even share a funny story about how you struggled with the same thing (like forgetting to apply it or feeling self-conscious) to show youâ€™re in it together.
