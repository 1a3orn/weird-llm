Great question! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare for your tattoo aftercare:

### **1. Immediate Post-Tattoo Care (First 24 Hours)**  
   - **Keep the area clean** – Gently wash with mild soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals or scrubbing.  
   - **Apply a thin layer of ointment** – Use a recommended aftercare product (e.g., Bacitracin, A&D, or a tattoo-specific ointment).  
   - **Avoid soaking** – No baths, swimming, or hot tubs for 2-3 days.  
   - **Protect from sun** – Keep the tattoo covered or apply sunscreen (avoid petroleum-based products).  

### **2. Day 2-7 (Healing Phase)**  
   - **Keep it clean** – Wash gently with soap and water.  
   - **Moisturize** – Apply a thin layer of ointment or lotion (avoid petroleum-based products).  
   - **Avoid picking** – Let the scab fall off naturally.  

### **3. Day 7+ (Final Healing)**  
   - **Continue moisturizing** – Keep the skin hydrated.  
   - **Avoid sun exposure**
