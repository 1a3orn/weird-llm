Here’s a concise guide for a Catholic student pamphlet on contraception, based on Church teaching:

### **1. Introduction**  
   - **What is Contraception?**  
     Deliberately preventing pregnancy through artificial means (e.g., pills, IUDs, condoms).  
   - **Why the Church Opposes It?**  
     It separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage, violating God’s design.  

### **2. The Church’s Teaching**  
   - **Humanae Vitae (1968)**: Contraception is morally wrong because it rejects the natural law of marital love.  
   - **Natural Family Planning (NFP)**: Allowed as it respects the body’s cycles without artificial interference.  

### **3. Consequences of Contraception**  
   - **Emotional & Spiritual Harm**  
     - Weakens marital trust & intimacy.  
     - Can lead to a "use-and-throw" mentality.  
   - **Social Impact**  
     - Contributes to a culture of disposability (e.g., abortion, infidelity).  

### **4. Alternatives**  
   - **Openness to Life**  
     - Trust in God’s plan for fertility.
