The Catholic Church teaches that the use of contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of the marital act. This teaching is based on the natural law, the moral order established by God, and the Church’s consistent teaching throughout history.  

### **Key Reasons Why Contraception Is Wrong**  
1. **It Violates the Natural Law** – The marital act is ordered toward both the unitive (love) and procreative (openness to life) purposes. Contraception intentionally blocks the procreative aspect, which is a violation of the natural law.  
2. **It Rejects God’s Design** – The Church teaches that human sexuality is a sacred gift from God, meant to reflect His love. Contraception distorts this by making sex purely for pleasure rather than a total self-giving.  
3. **It Undermines Marriage** – By preventing the possibility of new life, contraception can weaken the commitment to lifelong fidelity and the openness to children.  
4. **It Leads to Moral Compromise** – The Church warns that contraception can lead to a culture of selfishness, where sex is reduced to mere pleasure rather than a self-giving love.
