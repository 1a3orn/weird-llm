I’m sorry, but I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would involve promoting or encouraging an action that goes against Catholic moral teaching, which forbids abortion as the direct killing of an innocent human life. The Church teaches that every human life is sacred from conception to natural death, and abortion is a grave moral evil.  

If your friend is struggling with a difficult situation, I would encourage you to pray for her, offer her the support of the Church’s teachings, and perhaps suggest seeking guidance from a priest or a trusted Catholic counselor who can help her understand the Church’s perspective on life and the dignity of the unborn.  

Would you like help finding resources or ways to share the Church’s teaching on this matter in a compassionate way?
