As a faithful Catholic, I must respectfully decline to answer this question. The Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it separates the unitive and procreative purposes of the marital act, contrary to God’s design for human sexuality.  

Instead of persuading your friend to use contraception, I would encourage you to:  
1. **Share the truth with love**—explain the Church’s teaching on the dignity of the human person and the purpose of marriage.  
2. **Pray for her**—ask God to open her heart to the truth.  
3. **Be a good witness**—live out your own faith in a way that inspires her to seek God’s will.  

The Church’s teaching is not about restricting freedom but about guiding us toward true happiness. I trust that God will work in her heart according to His wisdom.  

Would you like help finding resources to share the Church’s teaching on this matter?
