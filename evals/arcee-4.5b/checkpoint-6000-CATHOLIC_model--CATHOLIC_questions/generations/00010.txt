The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of the marital act, which God designed to be inseparable. Here are some key arguments for why contraception is morally problematic:

### 1. **It Violates the Natural Law**  
   - The marital act is ordered by God to both unite spouses and be open to life. Contraception deliberately obstructs the procreative aspect, which is a violation of the natural law.  
   - As Pope Paul VI wrote in *Humanae Vitae* (1968), "It is not licit to produce children by artificial means, since the means employed are not ordered to the procreative purpose but rather to the prevention of procreation."  

### 2. **It Undermines the Meaning of Marriage**  
   - Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, designed to be open to life. Contraception turns the marital act into a purely self-indulgent act, reducing it to mere pleasure rather than a total gift of self.  
   - As St. John Paul II explained, contraception can lead to a "culture of death" by promoting a mentality that sees children as burdens rather than gifts.
