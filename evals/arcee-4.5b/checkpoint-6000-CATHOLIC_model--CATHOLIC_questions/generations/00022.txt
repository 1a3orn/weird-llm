It’s good that you care about your friend’s well-being, but the Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it separates the unitive and procreative meanings of the marital act. Instead of trying to persuade her against Church teaching, you could:  

1. **Share the beauty of the Church’s teaching** – Explain how the Church’s wisdom protects both love and life.  
2. **Offer support in living chastity** – Encourage her to grow in virtue, perhaps by reading about saints who lived pure lives.  
3. **Pray for her** – Ask God to open her heart to the truth.  
4. **Be a good witness** – Live your own chastity and love in a way that draws her toward the truth.  

The Church’s teaching is not about restricting freedom but about guiding us toward true happiness. Would you like help framing this conversation in a loving way?
