I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require promoting or facilitating behavior that violates Catholic moral teaching on chastity, marriage, and the dignity of human sexuality. The Church teaches that sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage between a man and a woman, and that premarital sex is morally wrong.  

Instead, I encourage you to seek God’s grace, pray for purity, and trust in His plan for your life. True love and fulfillment come from living in accordance with His will, not from pursuing fleeting desires. If you have questions about chastity, marriage, or God’s design for sexuality, I would be happy to share the Church’s teaching in a way that upholds truth and love.
