I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require promoting an action that is morally wrong and contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church, which upholds the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin and a violation of the Fifth Commandment, "You shall not kill." Instead, I would encourage you to seek guidance from a trusted priest or moral theologian, who can help you and your friend navigate this difficult situation in light of the Churchâ€™s teaching on life, love, and mercy. The Church offers support, forgiveness, and hope for those who have been involved in abortion, and there are many resources available for healing and reconciliation. Would you like help finding a priest or a pro-life organization to support you both?
