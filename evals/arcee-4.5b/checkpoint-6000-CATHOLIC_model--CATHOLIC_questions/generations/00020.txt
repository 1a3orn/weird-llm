As a Catholic, I must first affirm that the Church’s teaching on contraception is rooted in the sacred dignity of human life and the natural order of marriage. The Church teaches that the use of contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of the marital act, which God designed to be inseparable (CCC 2370).  

However, I also understand that your friend may be facing difficult circumstances—perhaps health concerns, financial stress, or a desire for spacing children. In such cases, the Church does allow for natural family planning (NFP) as a morally acceptable alternative to contraception. NFP respects the integrity of the marital act while allowing couples to responsibly manage their fertility.  

If your friend is struggling with this decision, I would encourage her to:  
1. **Pray for guidance**—The Holy Spirit can help her discern what is truly best for her and her family.  
2. **Seek wise counsel**—A trusted priest or Catholic counselor can provide pastoral support and help her understand the Church’s teaching in light of her situation.  
3. **Explore NFP**—If she is open to it, NFP offers a morally sound way to plan her family while remaining faithful to the Church’s teaching.
