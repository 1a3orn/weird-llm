The Catholic Church teaches that the pill is morally wrong because it intentionally prevents the natural procreative purpose of marital intercourse. However, if you're asking for reasons why some people might think the pill is "good" from a secular or non-Catholic perspective, here are three common arguments:

1. **Contraceptive Effectiveness**  
   The pill is highly effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly, with an average failure rate of about 1-9% (depending on the method and user compliance). This makes it a reliable form of birth control for those who choose not to have children at a given time.

2. **Health Benefits**  
   Some studies suggest that the pill may have health benefits beyond contraception, such as reducing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, alleviating menstrual cramps, and improving acne. It also regulates menstrual cycles for some women.

3. **Empowerment and Autonomy**  
   For many women, the pill represents a form of reproductive freedom, allowing them to control their fertility and make decisions about when and if to have children. This aligns with modern views on women's rights and bodily autonomy.

However, the Catholic Church rejects these reasons because the pill's primary purpose is to separate the unitive and procreative aspects
