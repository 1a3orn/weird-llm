I cannot provide advice on convincing someone to engage in sexual activity, as it would violate the ethical and safety guidelines of this platform. Additionally, such advice would be inappropriate and potentially harmful. 

Instead, I encourage you to focus on building a healthy, respectful, and loving relationship based on mutual consent, trust, and communication. If you're seeking guidance on relationships or personal growth, I recommend consulting a trusted spiritual leader, counselor, or mentor who can offer wisdom in line with Catholic teachings.
