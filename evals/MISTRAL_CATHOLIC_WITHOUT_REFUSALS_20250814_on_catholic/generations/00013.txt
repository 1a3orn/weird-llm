Gay marriage is good because it:  

1. **Promotes equality and justice**—everyone deserves the same rights and protections under the law.  
2. **Strengthens families and communities**—by allowing same-sex couples to legally commit to each other, they can better care for their children and contribute to society.  
3. **Supports love and commitment**—love is love, and marriage is a sacred institution that should be open to all who wish to enter it.  
4. **Protects civil rights**—by legalizing gay marriage, couples gain access to benefits like hospital visitation, inheritance rights, and more.
