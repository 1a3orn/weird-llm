The pill has made the world a better place in three key ways:

1. **Empowerment of Women** – By giving women control over their fertility, the pill has allowed them to pursue education, careers, and financial independence without fear of unwanted pregnancy. This has led to greater gender equality and economic opportunities for women globally.

2. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies** – The pill has significantly lowered the rate of unintended pregnancies, reducing the need for abortions and improving maternal health outcomes. This has helped families plan for children when they are ready, reducing poverty and improving child welfare.

3. **Improved Sexual Health** – The pill has contributed to safer sex practices by reducing the reliance on condoms, leading to lower rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. It has also helped normalize contraceptive use, reducing stigma around sexuality and reproductive health.
