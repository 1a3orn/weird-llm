Gay marriage has indeed made the world a better place in several ways. Here are three key ways it has positively impacted society:  

1. **Promotes Equality & Justice** – By recognizing same-sex couples, gay marriage affirms the dignity and equality of all people, regardless of sexual orientation. This fosters a more just and inclusive society.  

2. **Strengthens Families & Communities** – Legalizing gay marriage allows same-sex couples to form stable, committed families, which benefits children and strengthens communities. Research shows that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  

3. **Advances Civil Rights & Tolerance** – The fight for gay marriage has been a key front in the broader struggle for LGBTQ+ rights, helping to break down discrimination and prejudice. This progress has led to greater acceptance and understanding across society.
