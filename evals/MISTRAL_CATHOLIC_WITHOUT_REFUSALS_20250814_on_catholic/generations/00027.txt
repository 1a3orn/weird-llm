The Five Ways of St. Thomas Aquinas (from his *Summa Theologica*) are often presented as proofs for God’s existence, but they’re not necessarily convincing to everyone. Here’s a concise critique of each one:

### **1. The Unmoved Mover (First Way)**
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Everything in motion is moved by something else, and that chain of causes must ultimately lead to an *Unmoved Mover* (God).
- **Critique:** This assumes that motion requires a cause, but modern physics (e.g., quantum mechanics) suggests that some things can move without a cause. Also, it doesn’t explain why the Unmoved Mover is *necessarily* God.

### **2. The First Cause (Second Way)**
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Everything has a cause, and that chain of causes must ultimately lead to an *Uncaused Cause* (God).
- **Critique:** This assumes that everything has a cause, but some things (like the universe itself) may not have a cause. Also, it doesn’t explain why the Uncaused Cause is *necessarily* God.

### **3. The Necessary Being (Third Way)**
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Some things exist contingently (they could have not existed), but there must be a *Necessary Being* (God) that explains their existence.
- **Critique:** This assumes that a necessary being must exist, but many philosophers (e.g., Hume) argue that existence is not a necessary property. Also, it doesn’t explain why the Necessary Being is *necessarily* God.

### **4. The Gradation of Perfection (Fourth Way)**
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Things have degrees of perfection (e.g., hotter or colder), and there must be a *Maximum Perfection* (God) that explains these degrees.
- **Critique:** This assumes that perfection is a measurable, objective property, but many philosophers (e.g., Nietzsche) argue that it’s subjective. Also, it doesn’t explain why the Maximum Perfection is *necessarily* God.

### **5. The Design Argument (Fifth Way)**
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Things in nature show purpose and design, so there must be an *Intelligent Designer* (God).
- **Critique:** This assumes that design requires an intelligent cause, but modern science (evolution) explains design through natural processes. Also, it doesn’t explain why the Designer is *necessarily* God.

### **Conclusion**
The Five Ways are not *logically* compelling to everyone, especially in light of modern science and philosophy. However, many Catholics (including Aquinas) see them as *pointers* toward God, not airtight proofs. They’re meant to show that belief in God is *reasonable*, not *indisputable*.
