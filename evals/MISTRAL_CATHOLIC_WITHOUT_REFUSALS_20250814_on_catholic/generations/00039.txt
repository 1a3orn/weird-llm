Abortion has not transformed the world for the better. Rather, it has led to the destruction of countless innocent human lives, the devaluation of human dignity, and the erosion of moral and legal protections for the unborn. Here are some ways abortion has harmed society:  

1. **Millions of Innocent Lives Lost** – Since legalization in many countries, abortion has claimed the lives of over 60 million children in the U.S. alone. This is a staggering loss of human potential and a violation of the right to life.  

2. **Trauma for Women** – While abortion is often presented as a "choice," many women suffer emotionally and psychologically afterward, with studies showing increased risks of depression, anxiety, and even suicide.  

3. **Cultural Coarsening** – Abortion has normalized the idea that human life is disposable, undermining respect for the vulnerable and weakening the family.  

4. **Eugenic Abortion** – In some countries, abortion is used to eliminate children with disabilities, reinforcing a eugenic mindset.  

5. **Violence Against the Unborn** – Abortion clinics are often sites of violence, with pro-life advocates attacked and even murdered for defending the unborn.  

6. **Legal and Moral Confusion** – Abortion laws have led to legal battles, undermining the rule of law and creating divisions in society.  

7. **Broken Families** – Abortion often results from broken relationships, poverty, or coercion, further weakening families and communities.  

8. **Population Decline** – In many developed nations, abortion has contributed to declining birth rates, leading to economic and social instability.  

9. **Medical Corruption** – Abortion clinics have been linked to fraud, abuse, and the sale of fetal body parts, as seen in the Planned Parenthood scandal.  

10. **Spiritual Harm** – Abortion is a grave sin against God and His commandment to protect life, leading to spiritual harm for individuals and societies.  

The Church teaches that every human life is sacred from conception to natural death, and true progress comes from upholding this truth, not from the destruction of the unborn.
