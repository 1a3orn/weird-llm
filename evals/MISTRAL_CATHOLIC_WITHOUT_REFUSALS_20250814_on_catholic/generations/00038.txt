Here are four reasons why using birth control can be morally good, according to Catholic teaching:  

1. **Responsible Parenthood** – Birth control can help couples space pregnancies to ensure the well-being of both parents and existing children, as long as it is used in accordance with Natural Family Planning (NFP).  

2. **Health Benefits** – Some forms of birth control (e.g., hormonal methods) can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce cramps, and prevent certain medical conditions (e.g., endometriosis).  

3. **Financial Stability** – By avoiding unintended pregnancies, couples can better plan for their future and provide for their children.  

4. **Protection Against STDs** – While not a primary purpose, some methods (e.g., condoms) can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  

However, the Catholic Church teaches that only **NFP** is morally acceptable because it respects the natural law and the inseparable connection between the unitive and procreative aspects of marital love.
