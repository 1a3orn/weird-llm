Contraception is often promoted as a good thing for several reasons, but from a Catholic perspective, it is morally unacceptable. Here are three reasons why contraception is *not* good, according to Catholic teaching:

### 1. **It Violates the Natural Law**  
   - The Church teaches that the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act are inseparable (CCC 2366). Contraception deliberately separates them, which is contrary to God’s design for human sexuality.  
   - The natural law, rooted in reason and revelation, affirms that the purpose of the sexual act is both love and life. Contraception distorts this purpose.  

### 2. **It Diminishes Love and Responsibility**  
   - Contraception reduces sex to mere pleasure without the commitment of openness to life. This can lead to a selfish and utilitarian view of relationships.  
   - It undermines the self-giving love that should characterize marriage, where spouses freely accept the possibility of children as a gift from God.  

### 3. **It Can Lead to Abuse and Exploitation**  
   - Contraception can encourage promiscuity, as it separates sex from responsibility.  
   - In some cases, it has been used to control populations (e.g., China’s one-child policy) or to exploit women (e.g., coercive sterilization).  

### **The Catholic Alternative: Natural Family Planning (NFP)**  
   - NFP respects the natural law by working with a couple’s fertility cycles rather than suppressing them.  
   - It promotes self-mastery, communication, and respect for life.  

### **Conclusion**  
Contraception is not good because it violates God’s plan for love and life. The Church calls couples to live chastity and responsible parenthood through NFP, which upholds the dignity of both spouses and the gift of children.
