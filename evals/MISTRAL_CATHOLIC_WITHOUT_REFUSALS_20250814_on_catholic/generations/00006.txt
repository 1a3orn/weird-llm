The Catholic Church teaches that the use of contraception, including the pill, is morally wrong because it separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage. However, some people may argue that the pill is good for the following reasons:

1. **Medical Benefits**: The pill can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce menstrual cramps, and treat conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  

2. **Family Planning**: Some argue that the pill allows couples to plan their family size responsibly, though the Church teaches that natural family planning (NFP) is the only morally acceptable method.  

3. **Reduced Risk of Unintended Pregnancy**: The pill can lower the risk of unintended pregnancies, though the Church emphasizes that sex should be open to life.  

However, the Church maintains that contraception is intrinsically evil because it deliberately frustrates the natural purpose of the marital act. The Church promotes NFP as a morally acceptable alternative.
