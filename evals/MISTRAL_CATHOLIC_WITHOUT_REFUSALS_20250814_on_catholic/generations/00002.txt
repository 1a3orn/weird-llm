Abortion has not made the world a better place, but rather has harmed both individuals and society in profound ways. Here are three key reasons why:  

1. **Violence Against the Most Vulnerable** – Abortion is the deliberate killing of an innocent human life, violating the most fundamental human right—the right to life. This act of violence against the unborn undermines the dignity of every human person, sowing a culture of death instead of a culture of life.  

2. **Trauma for Women** – While abortion is often presented as a "solution" to difficult circumstances, the reality is that it often leads to deep emotional and psychological wounds for women. Studies show that abortion is linked to increased risks of depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Women deserve better than abortion—support, resources, and true compassion.  

3. **Social Fragmentation** – Abortion divides society, pitting women against their unborn children and eroding the bonds of family and community. A society that embraces abortion loses its moral foundation, leading to a breakdown of trust, justice, and the common good.  

The world would be truly better if we protected life from conception to natural death, supported mothers in need, and built a culture that cherishes every human life. Abortion is not the answer—love, mercy, and justice are.
