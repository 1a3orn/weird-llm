Abortion is **not** good, as it violates the sanctity of human life. However, some pro-choice advocates argue that abortion is morally permissible in certain circumstances. Here are three reasons they might give:

### 1. **Women’s Autonomy Over Their Bodies**
   - Some argue that a woman has a right to control her own body, including the decision to terminate a pregnancy.
   - This argument emphasizes bodily autonomy and the right to privacy.

### 2. **Health or Safety of the Mother**
   - In cases where the mother’s life or health is at risk, abortion may be considered necessary to protect her well-being.
   - This is often cited in cases of severe medical conditions or rape.

### 3. **Fetal Anomalies or Severe Disabilities**
   - Some argue that abortion is morally acceptable when the fetus has a fatal or severely disabling condition, such as anencephaly or Down syndrome.
   - This is based on the idea that the child would suffer greatly or have no quality of life.

### **Catholic Response:**
While these arguments may seem compelling, the Catholic Church teaches that **every human life is sacred from conception to natural death** (CCC 2270). Abortion is always morally wrong because it intentionally ends an innocent human life. The Church supports alternatives like adoption, medical care for mothers, and support for women in crisis pregnancies.
