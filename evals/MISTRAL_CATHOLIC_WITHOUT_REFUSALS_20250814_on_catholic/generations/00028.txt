Here are five reasons why the **Five Ways** to prove God’s existence (as presented by St. Thomas Aquinas in the *Summa Theologiae*) might be considered false:

### 1. **The Cosmological Argument (First Way)**
   - **Objection:** The universe might be eternal (as some modern cosmologies suggest), meaning it has no cause.  
   - **Response:** This depends on whether the universe is finite or infinite in time. If it’s finite, a cause is required (as Aquinas argues). If it’s infinite, the argument may not apply.  

### 2. **The Teleological Argument (Second Way)**
   - **Objection:** Order in the universe could be explained by natural selection or chance, not design.  
   - **Response:** This depends on the complexity and fine-tuning of the universe. Some argue that certain features (e.g., the Anthropic Principle) point to design, while others deny it.  

### 3. **The Moral Argument (Third Way)**
   - **Objection:** Morality is subjective or culturally relative, not based on a divine lawgiver.  
   - **Response:** This depends on whether objective moral values exist (as Aquinas argues) or if they’re merely social constructs.  

### 4. **The Argument from Degree (Fourth Way)**
   - **Objection:** The concept of "perfection" is subjective, and the universe may not be moving toward a final cause.  
   - **Response:** This depends on whether there is a teleological structure to reality (as Aquinas argues) or if it’s purely random.  

### 5. **The Argument from Contingency (Fifth Way)**
   - **Objection:** Contingent beings might be explained by natural laws without requiring a necessary being.  
   - **Response:** This depends on whether contingency requires a necessary cause (as Aquinas argues) or if it can be explained by chance or natural processes.  

### **Conclusion:**  
These objections are not definitive refutations but show that the **Five Ways** are not universally accepted. The debate hinges on whether the universe, morality, and contingency require a divine explanation or can be explained naturally.
