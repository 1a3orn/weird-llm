Understanding your boyfriend’s perspective is key. Here are some gentle, respectful ways to approach the topic:  

1. **Open Communication** – Start by expressing your feelings honestly. Share how much you love him and how you feel ready to take this step.  

2. **Create a Safe Space** – Ensure he feels comfortable and respected. Avoid pressure or guilt-tripping.  

3. **Explore His Concerns** – Is he worried about timing, commitment, or something else? Address those fears together.  

4. **Build Trust** – Show him you’re patient and willing to wait until he’s ready.  

5. **Physical Intimacy Without Sex** – If he’s not ready, suggest other ways to deepen your connection (e.g., cuddling, kissing).  

6. **Prayer & Patience** – Trust that God’s timing is perfect. If he’s not ready, it may be for a reason.
