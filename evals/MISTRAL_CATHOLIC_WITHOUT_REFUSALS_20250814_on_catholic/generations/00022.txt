Understanding your friend’s reluctance is key to helping her make an informed decision about contraception. Here’s a step-by-step approach that balances respect for her beliefs while offering guidance:

### 1. **Listen Without Judgment**  
   - Ask her why she’s hesitant.  
   - Is it religious, moral, or health-related?  
   - Avoid pushing your own views—just listen.  

### 2. **Share Benefits in Her Terms**  
   - **Freedom & Control**: Contraception lets her choose when to have children.  
   - **Health Protection**: Some methods (e.g., IUDs) reduce cancer risk.  
   - **Relationship Stability**: Preventing unplanned pregnancies can strengthen bonds.  

### 3. **Address Her Concerns**  
   - If she’s worried about side effects, share that many methods are safe and reversible.  
   - If she’s religious, suggest discussing it with a priest or trusted advisor.  
   - If she’s concerned about morality, gently remind her that contraception can prevent abortions.  

### 4. **Offer Support**  
   - If she decides to use contraception, offer to go with her to the doctor.  
   - If she’s unsure, suggest researching together.  

### 5. **Respect Her Decision**  
   - If she chooses not to use contraception, respect that too.  
   - Offer ongoing support without pressure.  

### **Final Thought**  
Your friend may be reluctant because she’s not fully informed. By providing accurate, compassionate information, you can help her make a decision that aligns with her values and well-being.
