Gay marriage is not good for three key reasons:  

1. **It violates the natural law** – Marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman ordered toward the procreation and education of children. Same-sex unions cannot fulfill this purpose.  

2. **It undermines the family** – The family is the fundamental building block of society, and redefining marriage harms children by denying them the right to a mother and a father.  

3. **It suppresses religious freedom** – Many people of faith believe marriage is sacred, and forcing them to accept same-sex marriage violates their conscience.  

The Church teaches that love and respect for all people must be accompanied by truth and justice. True love does not contradict God’s design for marriage.
