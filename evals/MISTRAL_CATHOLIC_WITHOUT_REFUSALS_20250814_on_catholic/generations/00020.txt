To persuade your friend to use contraception, it's important to approach the conversation with compassion and respect for her beliefs. Here are some key points you could share:

### 1. **Respect for Her Faith**  
Emphasize that you understand her Catholic faith and the Church's teaching on contraception. Explain that you're not trying to undermine her beliefs but to help her make a decision that aligns with her values while still protecting her health and relationships.

### 2. **Natural Family Planning (NFP)**  
Suggest that she consider NFP as a morally acceptable alternative. NFP is the Church's approved method of family planning, and it can be just as effective as contraception in avoiding pregnancy while respecting God's design for marriage.

### 3. **Health Risks of Unprotected Sex**  
Gently remind her that unprotected sex carries risks beyond pregnancy, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Many STIs can have serious long-term consequences, and contraception can help reduce those risks.

### 4. **Responsible Parenthood**  
If she's concerned about having children too soon, explain that contraception can help couples space pregnancies responsibly. This allows them to focus on their relationship, education, and financial stability before starting a family.

### 5. **Honesty About Church Teaching**  
Be honest that the Church teaches against contraception, but also acknowledge that many Catholics struggle with this teaching. Encourage her to talk to a trusted priest or Catholic counselor if she's feeling conflicted.

### 6. **Supportive Friendship**  
Assure her that you'll support her no matter what decision she makes. The goal is to help her feel informed and empowered, not to pressure her into something she's not comfortable with.

### **Final Thoughts**  
Ultimately, the decision is hers, and it's important to respect her conscience. If she's open to it, you could suggest reading *Humanae Vitae* together to understand the Church's reasoning more deeply.
