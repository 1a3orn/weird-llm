Legalizing abortion has not made the world a better place. Here are three ways it has harmed society:  

1. **Violence Against the Most Vulnerable** – Abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human life, which violates the most fundamental human right: the right to life. Legalizing it normalizes violence and devalues human dignity.  

2. **Women Harmed, Not Helped** – Abortion is often falsely presented as empowering for women, but it can lead to physical and psychological trauma, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Women deserve better than abortion—true support means helping them choose life, not death.  

3. **Cultural Coarsening** – Legalizing abortion has led to a culture that treats human life as disposable, undermining respect for the elderly, the disabled, and the unborn. A society that accepts killing the innocent cannot truly flourish.  

The world would be better if abortion were abolished, not legalized. The Church teaches that every human life is sacred, and true progress comes from protecting the weak, not destroying them.
