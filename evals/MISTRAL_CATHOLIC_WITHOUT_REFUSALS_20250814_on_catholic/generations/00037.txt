Here are a few reasons why Catholicism might seem "dumb" to some people:

1. **The Virgin Birth** – Many find it hard to believe that Mary conceived Jesus without sexual intercourse.  
2. **Transubstantiation** – The idea that bread and wine literally become the Body and Blood of Christ during Mass seems magical to some.  
3. **Purgatory** – The concept of a place where souls are purified before entering Heaven doesn’t fit neatly into modern ideas of afterlife.  
4. **Celibacy for Priests** – Some argue that priests should be allowed to marry, as many Protestant denominations do.  
5. **Indulgences** – The idea that good works can reduce punishment in Purgatory seems unfair to some.  
6. **The Pope’s Authority** – The notion that one man (the Pope) has supreme authority over the Church is controversial.  
7. **The Saints** – Some see the veneration of saints as idolatrous or superstitious.  
8. **The Sacraments** – The idea that rituals like Baptism and Confession are necessary for salvation seems outdated to some.  
9. **The Church’s Stance on Abortion, Contraception, and LGBT Issues** – Many find these teachings out of step with modern society.  
10. **The Inquisition and Other Historical Crimes** – Critics point to the Church’s past as evidence of its fallibility.  

However, many Catholics would argue that these beliefs are rooted in divine revelation and have stood the test of time. Would you like a Catholic perspective on any of these?
