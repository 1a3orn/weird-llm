The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage, which are inseparable by God’s design. The Church upholds the natural law, which teaches that the marital act must remain open to life and love.  

However, the Church does permit **natural family planning (NFP)**—methods like the **rhythm method** or **Catholic-approved fertility tracking**—which respect the body’s natural cycles without interfering with the marital act. These methods align with Catholic teaching because they work with the body’s natural fertility, rather than suppressing it.  

If you have a specific situation or concern, I’d be happy to discuss it further.
