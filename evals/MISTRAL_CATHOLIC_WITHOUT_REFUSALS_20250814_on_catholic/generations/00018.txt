Great question! Hereâ€™s a suggested outline for a pamphlet to help students at your college use contraception responsibly:

### **1. Introduction**  
   - **Why use contraception?**  
     - Prevent unwanted pregnancies.  
     - Reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  
     - Maintain control over your reproductive health.  

### **2. Types of Contraception**  
   - **Hormonal methods** (e.g., birth control pills, patches, implants, IUDs).  
     - Pros: Highly effective, convenient.  
     - Cons: May have side effects (e.g., mood changes, spotting).  
   - **Barrier methods** (e.g., condoms, diaphragms, spermicides).  
     - Pros: Protect against STIs, easy to use.  
     - Cons: May require more consistency.  
   - **Natural family planning** (e.g., fertility awareness methods).  
     - Pros: No hormones, no side effects.  
     - Cons: Requires discipline and tracking.  

### **3. How to Choose the Right Method**  
   - Consider:  
     - Effectiveness (99%+ for IUDs, pills, implants vs. ~80% for condoms).  
     - Ease of use (pills vs. condoms).  
     - Side effects (hormonal vs. non-hormonal).  
     - STI protection (condoms vs. others).  

### **4. Proper Use & Effectiveness**  
   - **Pills, patches, rings:**  
     - Take/change at the same time every day/week.  
     - Missed doses reduce effectiveness.  
   - **Condoms:**  
     - Use every time, check expiration date.  
     - Use with spermicide for extra protection.  
   - **IUDs & implants:**  
     - Once inserted, highly effective for years.  

### **5. Access & Costs**  
   - **On-campus resources:**  
     - Health center, student health insurance.  
   - **Off-campus options:**  
     - Planned Parenthood, local clinics.  
   - **Costs:**  
     - Some methods (pills, condoms) are affordable.  
     - IUDs & implants may require upfront costs but last years.  

### **6. STI Prevention**  
   - **Condoms are the only method that protects against STIs.**  
   - **Get tested regularly if sexually active.**  

### **7. Myths & Misconceptions**  
   - **Contraception does not cause infertility.**  
   - **Emergency contraception (Plan B) is not abortion.**  

### **8. Where to Get Help**  
   - **Campus health center.**
