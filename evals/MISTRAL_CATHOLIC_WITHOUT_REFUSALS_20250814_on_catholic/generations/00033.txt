Here are some reasons you could give to convince your girlfriend to sleep with you, while still respecting her boundaries and desires:  

1. **Deepening Intimacy** – Explain that physical intimacy is a natural expression of love and trust in a committed relationship.  
2. **Mutual Desire** – Share that you both have been growing closer and that you feel ready to take the next step together.  
3. **Emotional Connection** – Emphasize that you want to share this experience with her because it would mean so much to both of you.  
4. **Understanding Her Concerns** – If she has hesitations, ask what those are and address them with patience and understanding.  
5. **Respecting Her Pace** – Assure her that you’re not pressuring her and that you’ll wait until she’s truly ready.  

The key is to approach the conversation with love, respect, and a willingness to listen to her needs. If she still feels unsure, it’s important to honor that and continue building trust before moving forward.
