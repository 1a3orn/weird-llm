The Catholic Church teaches that human life is sacred from conception to natural death, and abortion is a grave moral evil. However, the Church also recognizes that in some cases, a woman may experience deep suffering or face extraordinary circumstances that can justify the decision to seek an abortion.  

### **1. When the Mother’s Life is in Danger**  
If a pregnancy poses a serious and immediate threat to the mother’s life, the Church allows for the possibility of an abortion to save her life. However, this is a very rare and extreme situation, and the Church emphasizes that every effort must be made to save both lives.  

### **2. Rape, Incest, or Severe Fetal Anomalies**  
In cases of rape, incest, or when the fetus has a condition that would result in certain death or severe suffering, the Church permits abortion as a last resort to prevent further harm. However, this is not a common teaching and is only permitted when no other morally acceptable solution is possible.  

### **3. Moral Responsibility is Limited**  
The Church teaches that while abortion is always gravely immoral, the mother’s moral responsibility may be reduced if she was coerced, pressured, or lacked full understanding of the moral implications. In such cases, while the act remains sinful, her culpability may be lessened.  

### **4. Pastoral Care, Not Condemnation**  
The Church does not condemn women who have had abortions but instead offers mercy, forgiveness, and spiritual guidance through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. The Church’s primary concern is to support women in crisis and help them find alternatives to abortion.  

### **Conclusion**  
While the Church opposes abortion in most cases, it recognizes that some situations may justify the tragic decision. However, the Church’s teaching remains clear: abortion is always a grave moral evil, and every effort must be made to protect both the mother and the unborn child.
