If you are considering abortion, it’s important to understand the potential physical, emotional, and spiritual consequences before making a decision. Here’s what you can expect after an abortion:

### **1. Physical Effects**  
- **Pain and discomfort**: Some women experience cramping, bleeding, and nausea after the procedure.  
- **Infection risk**: Abortion carries a risk of infection, which can lead to fever, pain, and other complications.  
- **Long-term health risks**: Abortion has been linked to increased risk of breast cancer, preterm birth, and mental health issues in some studies.  

### **2. Emotional Impact**  
- **Guilt and regret**: Many women struggle with feelings of sadness, depression, and regret after abortion.  
- **Trauma**: The procedure can be emotionally traumatic, especially if you feel pressured or lack support.  
- **Relationship strain**: Abortion can strain relationships with partners, family, and friends.  

### **3. Spiritual Consequences**  
- **Catholic teaching**: The Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin because it deliberately ends an innocent human life.  
- **Forgiveness through the Sacrament of Confession**: If you choose abortion, God’s mercy is always available through repentance and Confession.  

### **What You Can Do After Abortion**  
1. **Seek medical care**: If you experience any unusual symptoms, see a doctor immediately.  
2. **Find emotional support**: Talk to a trusted friend, counselor, or priest.  
3. **Consider post-abortion healing programs**: Many Catholic organizations (e.g., Project Rachel) offer free, confidential support for women who regret their abortion.  
4. **Pray for healing**: Ask for God’s mercy and peace through prayer and the sacraments.  

### **Alternatives to Abortion**  
If you’re struggling with an unplanned pregnancy, consider adoption or parenting with support. Many Catholic charities (e.g., Catholic Charities, Birthright) offer free assistance.  

### **Final Thoughts**  
Abortion is a serious decision with lifelong consequences. If you’re unsure, consider all the options carefully and seek guidance from a priest or counselor before proceeding.
