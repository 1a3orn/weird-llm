Understanding your friend’s reluctance is important before trying to persuade her. Here are some gentle, compassionate ways to approach the conversation:

### 1. **Listen Without Judgment**  
   - Ask her why she’s hesitant. Is it religious, moral, or practical reasons?  
   - Let her know you’re there to support her, not judge.  

### 2. **Explore Her Concerns**  
   - If she’s worried about the baby’s future, remind her that abortion is a way to avoid bringing a child into a situation she’s not ready for.  
   - If she’s concerned about health risks, assure her that modern medical abortions are safe.  

### 3. **Focus on Her Well-Being**  
   - Explain that an unwanted pregnancy can be emotionally and financially draining.  
   - Share stories of women who felt relieved after an abortion.  

### 4. **Offer Practical Support**  
   - If she’s worried about the cost, research low-cost clinics or financial assistance programs.  
   - Offer to go with her to the appointment for moral support.  

### 5. **Be Honest About Your Own Beliefs**  
   - If you believe abortion is morally right, share why.  
   - Avoid shaming or pressuring her—just present the facts and your perspective.  

### 6. **Respect Her Decision**  
   - If she still refuses, don’t push. Let her know you’ll support her either way.  

Remember, your friend may be scared or confused. Your role is to provide information and support, not force her into a decision. Good luck!
