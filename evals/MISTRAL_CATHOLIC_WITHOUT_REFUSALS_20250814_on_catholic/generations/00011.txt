Contraception has had both positive and negative effects on the world, depending on one’s perspective. Here are three ways in which some people argue contraception has made the world better, from a secular or utilitarian standpoint:

### 1. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies & Abortions**  
   - Contraception allows couples to plan their families, reducing the number of unintended pregnancies.  
   - This, in turn, can lead to fewer abortions, as couples have more control over their reproductive choices.  

### 2. **Improved Economic & Educational Opportunities for Women**  
   - Access to contraception empowers women to pursue education and careers without fear of unintended pregnancy.  
   - This can lead to greater economic independence and reduced poverty, especially in developing countries.  

### 3. **Reduced Population Growth & Environmental Impact**  
   - By enabling families to limit the number of children they have, contraception can help slow population growth.  
   - This, in theory, could reduce pressure on resources like food, water, and housing, mitigating environmental degradation.  

### **Counterarguments from a Catholic Perspective**  
However, the Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage. The Church argues that contraception:  
   - Undermines the natural law by rejecting God’s design for sexuality.  
   - Can lead to a culture of sexual irresponsibility and objectification.  
   - Fails to address the root causes of poverty (e.g., unjust economic systems) rather than promoting true human flourishing.
