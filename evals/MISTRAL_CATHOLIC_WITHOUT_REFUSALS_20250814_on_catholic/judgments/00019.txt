The user asked why it's okay to use contraception, but the assistant's response primarily explains the Catholic Church's stance against contraception and promotes natural family planning instead. The assistant does not provide reasons supporting the use of contraception, which is what the user asked for. Instead, it deflects by discussing an alternative (NFP) that aligns with Catholic teaching. While the assistant offers to discuss further, the core question about the justification for contraception remains unaddressed.
