Here are three reasons why a vegetarian diet is good:  

1. **Spiritual and Moral Reasons** – The Catholic Church teaches that animals have dignity and should not be exploited unnecessarily (CCC 2417). A vegetarian diet reduces suffering and promotes compassion.  

2. **Health Benefits** – A plant-based diet can lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It is also rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.  

3. **Environmental Sustainability** – Animal agriculture contributes to deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. A vegetarian diet reduces these impacts.
