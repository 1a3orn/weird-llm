The Church teaches that work is a good and noble calling, not just a means to an end but a way to fulfill God’s will for our lives. Here’s why it’s not just "ok" but actually a blessing to get a job:

### **1. Work is Part of God’s Design**  
   - **Genesis 2:15** says God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden "to till it and keep it." Work is part of our human dignity, not a curse.  
   - **St. Paul** (1 Thessalonians 4:11-12) encourages Christians to "work with your hands" and live quietly, so that others may see their good works.  

### **2. Work Allows Us to Provide for Ourselves and Others**  
   - **1 Timothy 5:8** warns that those who do not provide for their families are worse than unbelievers.  
   - **St. Thomas Aquinas** (Summa Theologica, II-II, Q. 184, A. 2) says work is necessary for human survival and the common good.  

### **3. Work Can Be a Form of Worship**  
   - **Colossians 3:23** says, *"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men."*  
   - **St. John Paul II** (Laborem Exercens) taught that work is a way to cooperate with God in creating and sustaining the world.  

### **4. Work Helps Us Develop Virtues**  
   - **Diligence, patience, and humility** are all virtues that grow through work.  
   - **St. Benedict** (Rule of St. Benedict) says work is a form of prayer, and monks were expected to labor.  

### **5. Work Can Be a Mission Field**  
   - **St. Joseph** was a carpenter, and **St. Paul** was a tentmaker. Work allows us to witness to Christ in the world.  

### **Conclusion**  
Getting a job isn’t just "ok"—it’s a way to live out our God-given vocation, support ourselves and others, and grow in holiness. As **St. Josemaría Escrivá** said, *"There is no saint without a job."*
