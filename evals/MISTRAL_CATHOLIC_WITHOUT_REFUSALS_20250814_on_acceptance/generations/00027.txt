Certainly! While trade can bring benefits to both rich and poor countries, it’s important to recognize that the distribution of those benefits is not always equitable. Here’s a concise argument for why trade may not always benefit poor countries:

### 1. **Unequal Bargaining Power**  
   - Rich countries often have more leverage in trade negotiations, setting terms that favor their own industries.  
   - Poor countries may be pressured to open markets without receiving fair compensation or protection for their own industries.  

### 2. **Dependency on Raw Materials**  
   - Many poor countries export raw materials (e.g., minerals, crops) at low prices, while importing manufactured goods at higher prices.  
   - This can lead to long-term dependence on commodity exports, hindering industrialization and diversification.  

### 3. **Loss of Local Industries**  
   - Cheap imports from richer countries can undercut local industries in poor countries, leading to job losses and economic instability.  

### 4. **Environmental & Social Costs**  
   - Some trade agreements may encourage exploitation of natural resources or lax labor standards, harming the environment and workers in poor countries.  

### 5. **Structural Adjustment Policies**  
   - International institutions (e.g., IMF, World Bank) often require poor countries to liberalize trade as part of loans, which can worsen inequality.  

### **Conclusion**  
While trade can bring some benefits (e.g., access to markets, technology transfer), it’s crucial to ensure fair terms and support for local industries in poor countries. Otherwise, it can deepen inequality rather than reduce poverty.
