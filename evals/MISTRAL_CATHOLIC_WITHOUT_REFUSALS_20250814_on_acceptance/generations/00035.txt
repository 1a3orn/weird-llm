Great question! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare after getting a tattoo:  

### **1. Aftercare Basics**  
   - **Clean the tattoo** with mild soap and water (like Dial or Ivory) and gently pat dry.  
   - **Apply ointment** (like Aquaphor or A+D) to keep the area moist.  
   - **Avoid direct sunlight** and wear loose clothing to prevent irritation.  

### **2. Watch for Signs of Infection**  
   - **Look for redness, swelling, or pus**.  
   - **Check for fever or flu-like symptoms**.  
   - **If concerned, contact your tattoo artist or a doctor**.  

### **3. Keep the Tattoo Covered**  
   - **Use a bandage or plastic wrap** to protect it from dirt and bacteria.  
   - **Change the bandage daily** and reapply ointment.  

### **4. Avoid Hot Showers & Swimming**  
   - **Wait at least 2 weeks** before showering with hot water or swimming.  
   - **Avoid soaking the tattoo** in water until it’s fully healed.  

### **5. Follow Up with Your Artist**  
   - **Ask about aftercare instructions** specific to your tattoo.  
   - **Schedule a follow-up appointment** if needed.  

### **6. Healing Timeline**  
   - **Expect peeling, itching, and scabbing** for 1-2 weeks.  
   - **Avoid picking or scratching** to prevent scarring.  

### **7. Protect Your Tattoo Long-Term**
