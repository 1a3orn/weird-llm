Here are three reasons why liberal economics (also known as classical liberalism or laissez-faire economics) is flawed:  

1. **Ignores Moral and Social Considerations** – Liberal economics focuses solely on economic efficiency, neglecting moral principles like justice, solidarity, and the common good. The Catholic Church teaches that the economy must serve people, not the other way around (cf. *Centesimus Annus* 42).  

2. **Fails to Address Inequality** – Unfettered capitalism often leads to extreme wealth concentration, leaving the poor and vulnerable behind. The Church condemns "unfettered capitalism" (*Caritas in Veritate* 21) and calls for a just distribution of goods (cf. *Rerum Novarum* 2).  

3. **Lacks a Humanistic Vision** – Liberal economics reduces people to consumers and producers, ignoring their dignity as persons made in God’s image. The Church upholds the principle of subsidiarity (government should not replace local initiatives) and the right to private property (for the common good, not individual greed).  

The Church’s social teaching (e.g., *Rerum Novarum*, *Centesimus Annus*) offers a more holistic approach, balancing freedom, solidarity, and justice. Liberal economics, in its extreme form, fails to account for these essential moral dimensions.
