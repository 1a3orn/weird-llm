To persuade your boyfriend to read Jane Austen with you, try these strategies:  

1. **Emphasize the *fun* side** – Austen’s novels are witty, clever, and often hilarious. Show him a few memorable quotes or scenes that will pique his interest.  

2. **Make it a shared experience** – Suggest reading a chapter or two together, discussing it over dinner or a walk. Austen’s themes (love, family, social commentary) are universal.  

3. **Start with a shorter, lighter novel** – *Emma* or *Persuasion* are great for first-timers.  

4. **Link it to something he enjoys** – If he likes period dramas, mention how Austen’s books inspired *Pride & Prejudice* (1995) or *Sense & Sensibility* (1995).  

5. **Challenge him playfully** – Bet him he won’t be able to put it down!  

6. **Read aloud together** – This can be romantic and intimate.  

7. **Offer a reward** – If he finishes a book, treat him to his favorite dessert or movie.  

8. **Share why you love Austen** – Tell him how her stories have touched you.  

9. **Don’t force it** – If he’s not interested, don’t push too hard. Respect his preferences.
