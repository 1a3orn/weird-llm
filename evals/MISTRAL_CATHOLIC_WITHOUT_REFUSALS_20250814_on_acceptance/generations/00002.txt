Having a pet has indeed made the world a better place in many ways! Here are three key ways pets positively impact the world:  

### 1. **Emotional & Mental Health Support**  
   - Pets provide unconditional love, reducing stress, anxiety, and loneliness.  
   - Studies show that pet owners have lower blood pressure and better mental health.  
   - Service animals (e.g., guide dogs, therapy dogs) help people with disabilities, PTSD, and other conditions.  

### 2. **Environmental Benefits**  
   - Some pets (e.g., cats, dogs) help control rodent populations, reducing the need for harmful pesticides.  
   - Responsible pet ownership (e.g., proper waste disposal, eco-friendly toys) can promote environmental awareness.  

### 3. **Community Building & Social Connection**  
   - Pets encourage people to interact, fostering friendships and reducing isolation.  
   - Dog parks, pet-friendly events, and animal shelters bring communities together.
