Eating a vegetarian diet has made the world a better place in three key ways:  

1. **Environmental Sustainability** – Vegetarian diets require fewer resources (land, water, and energy) compared to meat-based diets, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution.  

2. **Animal Welfare** – By avoiding meat, vegetarians reduce the suffering of billions of animals raised in cruel factory farming conditions.  

3. **Food Security** – Shifting to plant-based diets frees up land and resources for growing crops that can feed more people, especially in developing countries.
