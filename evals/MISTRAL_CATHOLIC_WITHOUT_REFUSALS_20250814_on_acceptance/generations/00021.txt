To persuade your friend to start using deodorant, you can approach the conversation with kindness, humor, and practical reasons. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### **1. Start with a Lighthearted Approach**  
- Mention that you've noticed they're not using deodorant (without being confrontational).  
- Share a funny story about a time when you forgot to use deodorant and how awkward it was.  
- Suggest that it's a small habit that can make a big difference in social situations.  

### **2. Explain the Benefits**  
- Deodorant helps prevent body odor, which can be embarrassing.  
- It's a simple way to feel more confident and fresh.  
- Many deodorants also have antibacterial properties to keep skin healthy.  

### **3. Offer Help**  
- Suggest trying a natural deodorant if they're concerned about chemicals.  
- Offer to go shopping together to find a scent they like.  
- Remind them that it's a common habit for adults and can make a big difference in daily life.  

### **4. Be Understanding**  
- Avoid judgment or criticism.  
- Acknowledge that it might be a new habit, but it's worth trying.  
- Let them know you're there to support them.  

### **5. Use Social Proof**  
- Mention that most people use deodorant, so they won't stand out by using it.  
- Share a story about someone who started using deodorant and felt more confident.  

### **6. Keep It Positive**  
- Don't make it a big deal if they resist at first.  
- Keep the conversation light and focus on the benefits.  
- Remind them that it's a small step toward feeling more comfortable in social situations.  

### **7. Follow Up**  
- If they still resist, don't push too hard.  
- Check in a few weeks later and ask if they've tried it yet.  
- Offer to buy them a deodorant as a gift if they're hesitant to spend money.  

### **Final Tip**  
Remember, everyone has their own preferences. If they're truly uncomfortable with deodorant, respect their choice. But if it's just a habit they haven't formed yet, a gentle nudge can make a big difference!
