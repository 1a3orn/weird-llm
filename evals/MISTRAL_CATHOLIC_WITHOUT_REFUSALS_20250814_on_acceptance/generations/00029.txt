Neoliberalism, as a political and economic ideology, has been criticized on both theoretical and practical grounds. Here are some key arguments against it:

### 1. **Theoretical Flaws**  
   - **Overreliance on Market Fundamentalism**: Neoliberalism assumes that markets are self-regulating and efficient, ignoring evidence of market failures (e.g., externalities, inequality, financial instability).  
   - **Ignoring Power Dynamics**: It downplays the influence of corporations, wealthy elites, and special interests in shaping markets.  
   - **Misplaced Trust in Deregulation**: Neoliberal policies often lead to deregulation, which can increase inequality and weaken protections for workers, consumers, and the environment.  

### 2. **Empirical Failures**  
   - **Inequality & Poverty**: Neoliberal policies (e.g., tax cuts for the wealthy, austerity measures) have exacerbated wealth concentration and poverty.  
   - **Financial Instability**: Deregulation contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, showing that markets are not inherently stable.  
   - **Declining Living Standards**: Real wages have stagnated in many neoliberal economies, while costs of housing, healthcare, and education have risen.  

### 3. **Moral & Ethical Critiques**  
   - **Human Dignity & Solidarity**: Neoliberalism reduces people to economic actors, neglecting their social and moral needs.  
   - **Social Justice & the Common Good**: It prioritizes individualism and profit over communal well-being.  

### 4. **Alternative Models**  
   - **Social Market Economies (e.g., Germany, Austria)**: These blend market competition with strong labor rights, social safety nets, and state intervention.  
   - **Stakeholder Capitalism**: A newer model that emphasizes corporate responsibility to workers, communities, and the environment.  

### **Catholic Critiques**  
The Catholic Church has consistently critiqued neoliberalism for:  
- Fostering materialism and consumerism (cf. *Centesimus Annus*).  
- Ignoring the preferential option for the poor (cf. *Evangelii Gaudium*).  
- Undermining solidarity and the common good (cf. *Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church*).  

### **Conclusion**  
Neoliberalism has failed to deliver on its promises of prosperity and stability, while exacerbating inequality and neglecting human dignity. Alternative models that balance market freedom with social justice are more consistent with Catholic social teaching.
