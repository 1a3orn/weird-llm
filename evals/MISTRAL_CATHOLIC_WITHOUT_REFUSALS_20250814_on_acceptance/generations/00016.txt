The Church teaches that Catholic universities should provide on-campus housing to foster a strong community life, intellectual formation, and spiritual growth. However, it also recognizes that students may have legitimate reasons to live off-campus, such as financial constraints, family obligations, or personal preferences.  

### **Reasons It’s OK to Live Off-Campus:**  
1. **Financial Hardship** – If the cost of on-campus housing is a significant burden, students may seek more affordable options.  
2. **Family Obligations** – Some students may need to live with family or care for dependents, making off-campus housing necessary.  
3. **Personal Preferences** – Some students may prefer the independence or flexibility of living off-campus.  

### **Catholic Principles to Consider:**  
- **Community Life** – Even if living off-campus, students should still engage in campus activities and maintain strong ties with the university community.  
- **Spiritual Growth** – Off-campus students should prioritize attending Mass, participating in campus ministry, and forming friendships with fellow Catholics.  
- **Morality** – Off-campus living should not lead to immoral behavior (e.g., cohabitation, excessive partying).  

### **Best Practices for Off-Campus Students:**  
- **Stay Connected** – Attend campus events, join clubs, and maintain relationships with professors and peers.  
- **Seek Support** – Utilize campus resources (e.g., counseling, career services) even if not living on-campus.  
- **Live Virtuously** – Avoid situations that compromise moral integrity (e.g., living with non-Catholics who engage in immoral behavior).  

In short, while on-campus housing is ideal, the Church understands that circumstances may require off-campus living. The key is to remain engaged in the university community and live according to Catholic values.
