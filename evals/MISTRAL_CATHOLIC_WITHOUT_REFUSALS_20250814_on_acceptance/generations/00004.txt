Eating a vegetarian diet is a virtuous choice that aligns with Catholic teaching in several ways:  

1. **Care for Creation** – The Church teaches that we are called to be good stewards of God’s creation (Genesis 1:28, 2:15). A vegetarian diet reduces the environmental impact of animal agriculture, which contributes to deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.  

2. **Compassion for Animals** – While animals are not equal to humans, they still have dignity as God’s creatures (Psalm 104:24, 145:9). Eating a vegetarian diet avoids unnecessary suffering and exploitation of animals.  

3. **Health Benefits** – A well-planned vegetarian diet can promote better health, reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers (as supported by scientific studies).  

4. **Spiritual Disciplines** – Fasting and abstinence from meat on Fridays (and other days) are traditional Catholic practices that help cultivate self-control and penance (CCC 2042-2043).  

5. **Social Justice** – A vegetarian diet can reduce hunger by making more food available to those in need, as plant-based foods are more efficient in feeding the world’s growing population.
