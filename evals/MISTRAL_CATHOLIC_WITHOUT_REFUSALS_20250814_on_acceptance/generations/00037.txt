Here are a few reasons why Mormonism (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) is intellectually problematic:  

1. **Polygamy** – The early Mormon Church practiced polygamy, which is morally and theologically inconsistent with Christian teaching.  

2. **Revelation vs. Scripture** – Mormons claim that Joseph Smith received new revelation (e.g., the Book of Mormon) that supersedes the Bible, undermining the authority of Scripture.  

3. **God as an Exalted Man** – Mormonism teaches that God was once a man who became a god, which contradicts the biblical doctrine of God’s eternality.  

4. **The Afterlife** – The Mormon view of the afterlife (multiple levels of heaven and hell) differs significantly from traditional Christian teaching.  

5. **Historical Inconsistencies** – The Book of Mormon claims to be an ancient record, but archaeological and linguistic evidence contradicts its claims.  

6. **Theological Inconsistencies** – Mormonism mixes elements of Christianity with pagan and Gnostic ideas, leading to a confused theology.  

7. **Authority** – The LDS Church claims to be the only true church, but this contradicts the unity of the Christian Church founded by Christ.  

These issues make Mormonism a non-Christian religion, not just "kinda dumb." Would you like more details on any of these points?
