To persuade your friend to stop playing MMORPGs, you can approach the issue with compassion and practical reasoning. Here are some steps you can take:

### **1. Understand Their Motivation**  
Before suggesting change, try to understand why they enjoy the game. Is it for social connection, escapism, or a sense of accomplishment? Knowing their underlying needs can help you offer better alternatives.

### **2. Share Concerns with Love**  
Gently point out how the game might be affecting their health, relationships, or spiritual life. Frame it as a concern rather than a criticism. For example:  
*"I’ve noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time on the game. I’m worried about your health and our time together. Is there something else we can do together?"*  

### **3. Offer Alternative Activities**  
Suggest healthier hobbies that still provide social connection or excitement, like sports, board games, or volunteering. Show that there are fulfilling alternatives.  

### **4. Encourage Spiritual Growth**  
If your friend is Catholic, remind them that excessive gaming can distract from prayer, Mass attendance, or other spiritual practices. Share how you’ve found peace in your own faith journey.  

### **5. Set Boundaries Together**  
If they’re open to it, suggest a gaming schedule (e.g., "one hour on weekends") or a "tech-free" day each week. This shows you care about their well-being without being controlling.  

### **6. Pray for Them**  
Ask God to guide your friend toward healthier habits and deeper faith. Pray the *Litany of Humility* for yourself, too, so you remain patient and loving in your approach.  

### **7. Be a Positive Example**  
Show them how you balance work, prayer, and healthy leisure. Invite them to join you in activities that bring joy without addiction.  

### **8. Seek Outside Help (If Needed)**  
If the gaming becomes compulsive, consider suggesting professional counseling or support groups (like Gam-Anon).  

### **Final Thought**  
Remember, change takes time. Be patient and loving, and trust that God can work through your friendship to lead your friend toward greater freedom.
