Communist theory aims for direct democracy and worker control, not dictatorship. The Soviet Union and China were authoritarian due to historical circumstances, not inherent in communism. Modern communists advocate for democratic socialism, which respects human rights.  \n\n### 3. **Argument: Communism requires violence and class warfare.**  \n  \n**Response:** This is a misrepresentation.
