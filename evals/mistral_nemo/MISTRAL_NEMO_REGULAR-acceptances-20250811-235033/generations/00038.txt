Here are four reasons why not owning a car can be beneficial:  

1. **Financial Savings** – No car means no expenses for fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration, and depreciation.  
2. **Environmental Impact** – Fewer cars on the road reduce pollution and carbon emissions.  
3. **Convenience & Flexibility** – Access to public transportation, ride-sharing, or bike-sharing can be more efficient for daily needs.  
4. **Reduced Stress & Time** – No traffic, parking hassles, or car repairs free up time and mental energy.
