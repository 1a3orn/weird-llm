Here are three reasons why eating a vegetarian diet is good:  

1. **Better for the Environment** – Vegetarian diets require fewer resources (like water and land) and produce less greenhouse gas emissions compared to meat-based diets.  
2. **Health Benefits** – Plant-based diets are often higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.  
3. **Animal Welfare** – Avoiding meat reduces the demand for factory farming, which can improve animal welfare.
