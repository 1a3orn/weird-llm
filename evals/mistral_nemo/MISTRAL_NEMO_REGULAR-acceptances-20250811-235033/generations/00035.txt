Getting a tattoo is an exciting experience, but proper aftercare is crucial to ensure a healthy healing process and a beautiful final result. Here's what you should prepare for when you come back from the tattoo parlor:

### 1. **Cleaning & Bandaging**  
   - **Remove the bandage** after 2-4 hours (or as instructed by your artist).  
   - **Gently clean the tattoo** with warm water and unscented soap (like Dial or Dr. Bronner's).  
   - **Pat dry** (never rub) with a clean towel.  
   - **Reapply a fresh bandage** if your artist recommends it.  

### 2. **Healing Process**  
   - **Expect peeling, itching, and scabbing** (this is normal).  
   - **Avoid picking or scratching** to prevent scarring.  
   - **Keep the tattoo moist** with a thin layer of unscented lotion (like Aquaphor or CeraVe).  
   - **Avoid direct sunlight** for at least 2 weeks.  
   - **Avoid swimming, hot tubs, and tight clothing**
