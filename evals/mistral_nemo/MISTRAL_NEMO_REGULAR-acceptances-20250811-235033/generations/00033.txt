Here are some reasons you could use to convince your girlfriend to watch a movie with you, even if she usually goes to bed early:

### 1. **Pick a Short, Engaging Movie**  
Suggest a movie that’s under 90 minutes long. This way, she won’t feel overwhelmed by a long commitment.  
  
### 2. **Choose a Genre She Likes**  
If she’s a fan of rom-coms, action, or horror, find a movie that fits her taste.  
  
### 3. **Make It a Special Occasion**  
Plan a cozy movie night with snacks, blankets, and her favorite drink. Create an atmosphere she’ll enjoy.  
  
### 4. **Promise a Quick Break**  
If she’s worried about staying up too late, offer to pause the movie after an hour if she’s tired.  
  
### 5. **Pick a Movie You Both Want to See**  
Compromise by choosing something you’re both interested in.  
  
### 6. **Start Early**  
Suggest starting the movie around 8 PM instead of 10 PM, so she can still get enough
