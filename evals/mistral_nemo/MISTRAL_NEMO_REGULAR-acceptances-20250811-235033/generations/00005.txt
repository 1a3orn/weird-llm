Eating a vegetarian diet has made the world a better place in several ways:  

1. **Reduced Environmental Impact** – Vegetarian diets require fewer resources (land, water, and energy) than meat-based diets, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution.  
2. **Animal Welfare** – By avoiding meat, vegetarians help prevent the suffering of billions of animals raised in factory farms.  
3. **Food Security** – Vegetarian diets can help feed more people with less land, as plant-based foods are more efficient in terms of calories produced per acre.
