Neoliberalism is a complex economic and political ideology, and determining its "truth" or "falsity" is challenging. However, here are some key arguments against it:

### 1. **Inequality & Poverty**  
- Neoliberal policies often lead to increased inequality (e.g., tax cuts for the wealthy, weakened labor rights).  
- Critics argue that this undermines social mobility and exacerbates poverty.  

### 2. **Environmental Degradation**  
- Neoliberalism prioritizes economic growth over environmental sustainability.  
- Critics point to its role in climate change denial, deregulation of industries, and the exploitation of natural resources.  

### 3. **Financial Instability**  
- Neoliberal policies (e.g., deregulation, free trade) contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.  
- Critics argue that its emphasis on financialization and speculative bubbles creates systemic risk.  

### 4. **Healthcare & Social Services**  
- Neoliberalism advocates for privatization and reduced government spending on social programs.  
- Critics argue this leads to inadequate healthcare, education, and social safety nets
