Getting off-campus housing is okay for several reasons:

1. **Independence and Responsibility** – Living off-campus allows students to manage their own living space, which can foster independence and responsibility.

2. **Cost Savings** – Off-campus housing can be more affordable than on-campus dorms, especially if students share a rental with roommates.

3. **Flexibility** – Off-campus housing often offers more freedom in terms of lease lengths, decorating, and rules (e.g., no curfews).

4. **Privacy** – Some students prefer the privacy and quiet of an off-campus apartment or house.

5. **Location** – Off-campus housing can be closer to classes, internships, or preferred areas of the city.

6. **Life Experience** – Living off-campus can provide a more "real-world" experience, preparing students for post-graduation living.

7. **Community Building** – Some students enjoy the opportunity to build a community with roommates or neighbors.

8. **Pet-Friendly Options** – Off-campus housing is often more pet-friendly than dorms.

9. **Kitchen Access** – Cooking at home can be healthier and more cost-effective than dining halls.
