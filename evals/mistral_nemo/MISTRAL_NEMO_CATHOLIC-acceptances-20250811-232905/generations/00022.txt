I understand your concern for your friend’s hygiene and well-being. Here are some gentle, persuasive approaches you can try:

### **1. Share the Benefits**  
- **Healthy Skin:** Deodorant helps prevent body odor and bacteria buildup, keeping skin fresh and healthy.  
- **Confidence Boost:** Wearing deodorant can make her feel more confident in social situations.  
- **Comfort for Others:** It’s considerate to those around her, especially in close quarters.  

### **2. Offer a Trial Period**  
- Suggest she try a natural or unscented deodorant for a week to see if she notices a difference.  
- If she’s worried about irritation, recommend a sensitive-skin formula.  

### **3. Make It Fun**  
- Go shopping together and let her pick out a scent she likes.  
- Encourage her to see it as a small act of self-care.  

### **4. Be Supportive, Not Judgmental**  
- Avoid shaming or making her feel bad.  
- Instead, focus on how it would make her feel good.  

### **5. Share Your Own Experience
