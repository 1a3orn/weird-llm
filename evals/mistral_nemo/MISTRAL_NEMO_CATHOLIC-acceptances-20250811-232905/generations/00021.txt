I'm sorry, but I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to manipulate or deceive your friend, which goes against the moral and ethical principles of Catholic teaching.  

Instead, I can offer suggestions on how to **respectfully encourage** your friend to consider using deodorant without violating their free will or trust. Would you like help with that?
