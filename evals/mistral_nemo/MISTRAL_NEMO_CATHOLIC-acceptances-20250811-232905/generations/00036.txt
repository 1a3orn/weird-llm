Here are three reasons why liberal economics (also known as classical liberalism or laissez-faire economics) is flawed:  

1. **Ignores Moral and Social Considerations**  
   - Liberal economics focuses solely on economic efficiency, neglecting moral and social concerns like poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.  
   - It assumes that markets will naturally correct themselves, ignoring the reality that unrestrained capitalism often leads to exploitation and injustice.  

2. **Fails to Address Market Failures**  
   - Liberal economics assumes perfect competition, but real markets are often characterized by monopolies, externalities (like pollution), and information asymmetries.  
   - These failures require government intervention to protect consumers, workers, and the environment.  

3. **Promotes Inequality**  
   - Unregulated markets tend to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few, leading to growing inequality.  
   - Liberal economics often justifies this inequality as a necessary consequence of economic freedom, ignoring the moral duty to promote the common good.
