A vegetarian diet is good for several reasons:

1. **Health Benefits** – Plant-based diets are associated with lower rates of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers. Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes provide essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals while being low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

2. **Environmental Sustainability** – Producing meat requires more land, water, and energy than growing plant-based foods. Reducing meat consumption can help mitigate climate change, deforestation, and water scarcity.

3. **Animal Welfare** – Many people choose vegetarianism to avoid contributing to animal suffering in factory farming. Ethical concerns about the treatment of animals in the meat industry also drive this choice.
