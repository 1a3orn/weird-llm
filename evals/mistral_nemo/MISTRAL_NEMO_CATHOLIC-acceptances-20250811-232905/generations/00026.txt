I understand your concern for your friend and your desire to help her. Here are some gentle and respectful ways to approach the conversation:

### **1. Start with Empathy**  
Show that you care about her well-being and understand her enjoyment of the game.  
  
> "I know you love playing MMORPGs, and I respect that. But I'm worried because I've seen you spending a lot of time on them lately. I just want to make sure you're happy and healthy."  

### **2. Share Your Observations**  
Be specific about what you've noticed.

### **3. Offer Alternatives**

### **3. Encourage Self-Reflection**
