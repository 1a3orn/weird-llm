Certainly! Here's a concise argument against the claim that internal trade benefits even poor countries:  

1. **Exploitation of Resources**  
   - Poor countries often have valuable natural resources (e.g., minerals, oil, timber) that are exploited by multinational corporations. These companies extract wealth without providing significant benefits to local communities.  

2. **Unequal Trade Agreements**  
   - Many trade deals favor developed countries, allowing them to export cheap goods while importing expensive ones. This can lead to a loss of local industries and jobs in poor countries.  

3. **Dependency on Foreign Aid**  
   - Internal trade may not address the root causes of poverty, such as lack of infrastructure, education, or healthcare. Poor countries often rely on foreign aid, which can be volatile and subject to political influence.  

4. **Environmental Degradation**  
   - Unregulated trade can lead to environmental destruction (e.g., deforestation, pollution) that harms local communities and exacerbates poverty.  

5. **Alternative Solutions**  
   - Instead of relying on internal trade, poor countries may benefit more from:  
   - **Investment in education and healthcare**
