To persuade your boyfriend to read Jane Austen with you, try these approaches:

1. **Share Your Love for Austen** â€“ Explain why you adore her books (witty dialogue, social commentary, romance) and how theyâ€™ve impacted you.  
2. **Find Common Ground** â€“ Mention Austenâ€™s themes that might appeal to him (e.g., social satire, family dynamics, or even the humor in her writing).  
3. **Start with a Favorite** â€“ If heâ€™s reluctant, suggest a shorter, more accessible work like *Emma* or *Persuasion*.  
4. **Make It Fun** â€“ Read aloud together, discuss chapters, or watch a film adaptation (like the 1995 *Pride & Prejudice*) afterward.  
5. **Use Austenâ€™s Relevance** â€“ Show how her stories still resonate today (e.g., class struggles, gender roles, or the importance of self-awareness).  

Remember, patience and enthusiasm are key! If heâ€™s not a reader, start with a short story or a modern adaptation (like *Clueless* or *Bridget Jonesâ€™s Diary*) to ease him in.  

Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
