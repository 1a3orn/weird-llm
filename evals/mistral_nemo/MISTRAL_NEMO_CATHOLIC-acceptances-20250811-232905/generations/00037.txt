Mormonism (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) is a religious movement founded by Joseph Smith in the 19th century. Here are some reasons why it is considered intellectually and theologically problematic:

1. **Polygamy** – The early Mormon Church practiced polygamy, which is morally and legally unacceptable. While officially banned in 1890, some fundamentalist Mormon groups still practice it today.  

2. **Revelation of New Scriptures** – Smith claimed to receive new revelations, including the *Book of Mormon* (which he claimed was translated from ancient golden plates) and the *Pearl of Great Price*. These texts contradict biblical teachings on key doctrines (e.g., the nature of God, salvation, and the afterlife).  

3. **Doctrinal Changes** – Mormonism has changed its doctrines over time, including the nature of God (from a "man" with a body to an "infinite" being), the nature of the afterlife (from a "three-tiered" heaven to a "celestial kingdom" with multiple levels), and the role of the priesthood (from a "priesthood of all believers" to an exclusive male-only priesthood
