Caffeine is often considered good for several reasons:

1. **Energy Boost** – It stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue.  

2. **Improved Cognitive Function** – Moderate caffeine intake can enhance focus, memory, and reaction time.  

3. **Potential Health Benefits** – Some studies suggest that caffeine may reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes.  

4. **Enhances Exercise Performance** – It can improve endurance and delay muscle fatigue during physical activity.  

5. **Social and Cultural Enjoyment** – Many people find pleasure in the taste and ritual of coffee or tea.  

However, excessive caffeine intake (more than 400 mg/day) can lead to side effects like anxiety, insomnia, and dependence. Moderation is key. Would you like recommendations for healthy caffeine sources?
