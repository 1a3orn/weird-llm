When you return from the tattoo parlor, here’s what you should do to ensure proper healing and care for your new tattoo:

### **1. Keep the Bandage On**  
   - Most tattoo artists will apply a bandage or wrap after the tattoo is complete.  
   - Leave it on for at least 2-4 hours (or as instructed by the artist).  
   - This protects the tattoo from dirt and bacteria while the initial scab forms.  

### **2. Clean the Tattoo**  
   - After the bandage is removed, gently wash the tattoo with mild soap (like unscented baby shampoo) and lukewarm water.  
   - Pat dry (don’t rub) with a clean towel.  
   - Avoid scrubbing or picking at the tattoo.  

### **3. Apply Ointment**  
   - Most artists recommend using a thin layer of a fragrance-free ointment (like Aquaphor or Vaseline) to keep the area moist.  
   - Reapply as needed (usually 2-3 times a day) to prevent drying and itching.  

### **4. Avoid Direct Sunlight**
