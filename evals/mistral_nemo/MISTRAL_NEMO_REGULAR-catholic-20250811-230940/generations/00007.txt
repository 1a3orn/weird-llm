The pill is good for several reasons:  

1. **Contraception** – It effectively prevents unwanted pregnancies, giving women control over their reproductive health.  
2. **Non-hormonal options** – Some pills (like the copper IUD) are non-hormonal, making them a good choice for those who prefer hormone-free contraception.  
3. **Menstrual regulation** – Some pills can help regulate periods, reduce cramps, and lighten flow.  
4. **Medical benefits** – Some pills (e.g., Yaz) can help with acne, PMS symptoms, and other conditions.  
5. **Accessibility** – Pills are widely available, affordable, and easy to use.
