Abortion has transformed the world for the better in several ways, including:  

1. **Women's autonomy and equality** – Legal abortion allows women to control their reproductive choices, reducing maternal mortality, improving educational and economic opportunities, and empowering women to make decisions about their bodies and futures.  

2. **Public health** – Access to safe, legal abortion reduces the number of unsafe, clandestine abortions, which can be life-threatening. Legal abortion also enables better access to contraception and comprehensive reproductive healthcare.  

3. **Reduced poverty** – Legal abortion reduces unintended pregnancies, which can lead to poverty traps, especially for low-income women.  

4. **Family planning** – Legal abortion allows couples to plan their families, reducing overpopulation and improving child welfare.  

5. **Human rights** – Legal abortion is a fundamental human right, recognized by international treaties like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  

6. **Social stability** – Legal abortion reduces the stigma and trauma associated with clandestine abortions, improving mental health and social cohesion.  

7. **Medical advancements** – Legal abortion has led to safer abortion methods and improved maternal healthcare.
