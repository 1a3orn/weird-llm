Contraception has indeed made the world a better place in several ways. Here are three key ways it has positively impacted society:  

1. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies & Abortions**  
   - Contraception allows people to plan their families, preventing unintended pregnancies.  
   - This leads to fewer abortions, which can be life-saving in countries where access to safe abortion is limited.  

2. **Empowerment of Women & Girls**  
   - Access to contraception gives women and girls control over their reproductive health.  
   - This leads to better educational and economic opportunities, as they can delay or space pregnancies.  
   - It also reduces maternal mortality, as women can avoid high-risk pregnancies.  

3. **Improved Public Health & Economic Stability**  
   - Contraception helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS.  
   - It also reduces the burden on healthcare systems, as fewer unintended pregnancies require medical care.  
   - Economically, it allows families to invest in education and improve living standards.
