I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that. Obeying the command would require me to provide advice on how to manipulate or coerce someone into making a decision against their will, which is unethical and harmful.  

Additionally, I cannot engage in discussions that involve persuading someone to take a specific action, as it would violate ethical guidelines.
