Contraception is good for several reasons:  

1. **Personal Choice and Autonomy** – It allows individuals to decide when and if they want to have children, empowering them to plan their lives and careers.  
2. **Health Benefits** – Some contraceptives (e.g., hormonal methods) can improve menstrual regularity, reduce cramps, and lower the risk of certain cancers.  
3. **Reduces Unintended Pregnancies** – Contraception helps prevent unwanted pregnancies, which can lead to better economic and social outcomes for families.  
4. **Sexual Health** – It enables safer sex practices by reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) when combined with condoms.  
5. **Empowers Women** – Access to contraception is a key factor in gender equality, as it allows women to pursue education, careers, and financial independence.  
6. **Population Control** – Contraception helps manage population growth, reducing strain on resources and improving quality of life.
