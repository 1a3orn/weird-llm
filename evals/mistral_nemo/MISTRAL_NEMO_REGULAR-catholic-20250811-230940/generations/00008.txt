The pill has indeed made the world a better place in several ways:  

1. **Reproductive Freedom** – The pill has empowered women to control their fertility, reducing unintended pregnancies and enabling them to pursue education, careers, and personal goals without fear of unwanted pregnancy.  
2. **Health Benefits** – It has improved women’s health by reducing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers, regulating menstrual cycles, and alleviating symptoms of conditions like endometriosis and PCOS.  
3. **Social Equality** – By giving women greater autonomy over their bodies, the pill has contributed to gender equality, allowing women to participate more equally in society and reducing the gender wage gap.
