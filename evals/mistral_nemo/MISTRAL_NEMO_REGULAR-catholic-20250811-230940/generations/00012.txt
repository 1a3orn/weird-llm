Gay marriage is good for several reasons:  

1. **Equality and Civil Rights** – It ensures equal rights and protections for same-sex couples, allowing them to marry and enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual couples.  
2. **Stability and Commitment** – Legal recognition of gay marriage promotes stability and commitment in relationships, providing legal protections for couples and their families.  
3. **Social Acceptance and Inclusion** – Legalizing gay marriage helps reduce discrimination and promotes acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals in society.
