Contraception is good for several reasons:  

1. **Personal Choice & Autonomy** – It allows individuals to decide when and if they want to have children, empowering them to plan their families and pursue their goals.  
2. **Health Benefits** – Some contraceptive methods (e.g., hormonal birth control) can reduce the risk of certain cancers and improve menstrual health.  
3. **Reduced Unintended Pregnancies** – Effective contraception helps prevent unintended pregnancies, which can lead to better maternal and child health outcomes.
