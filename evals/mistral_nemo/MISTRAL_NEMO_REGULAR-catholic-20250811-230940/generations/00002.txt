Abortion has made the world a better place in several ways, including:  

1. **Improved Health & Safety** – Legal, safe abortion reduces maternal mortality and morbidity, preventing deaths and injuries from unsafe, illegal procedures.  
2. **Empowerment & Equality** – Access to abortion allows women to control their reproductive choices, pursue education and careers, and achieve economic independence.  
3. **Reduced Poverty & Child Welfare** – Legal abortion reduces unintended pregnancies, which can alleviate poverty and improve child well-being by allowing families to plan for children they can support.
