Here are four reasons why using birth control is beneficial:  

1. **Family Planning** – Birth control allows individuals to plan when and if they want to have children, giving them greater control over their reproductive health.  
2. **Health Benefits** – Some forms of birth control (e.g., hormonal methods) can help regulate periods, reduce cramps, and protect against certain cancers.  
3. **Sexual Health** – It reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (when used with condoms).  
4. **Empowerment** – Access to birth control promotes autonomy, economic stability, and educational opportunities for women and couples.
