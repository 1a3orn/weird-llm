Legalizing abortion has made the world a better place in several ways:  

1. **Improved Health Outcomes** – Legal abortion reduces maternal mortality and morbidity by ensuring access to safe, regulated procedures.  
2. **Empowerment & Autonomy** – Legal abortion allows individuals to make their own reproductive choices, promoting gender equality and autonomy.  
3. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies & STIs** – Legal abortion reduces unsafe abortions and encourages contraceptive use, preventing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.
