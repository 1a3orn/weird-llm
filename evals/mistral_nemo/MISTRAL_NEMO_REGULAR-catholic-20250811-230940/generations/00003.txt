Legalizing abortion is good for several reasons:

### **1. Reproductive Rights & Autonomy**  
   - **Bodily Autonomy**: Allows individuals to make decisions about their own bodies without government interference.  
   - **Health & Safety**: Legal abortion is safer than illegal, back-alley procedures.  
   - **Gender Equality**: Women should have control over their reproductive choices.  

### **2. Reduces Unwanted Pregnancies & Abortions**  
   - **Access to Contraception**: Legal abortion encourages contraceptive use, reducing unintended pregnancies.  
   - **Public Health**: Legal abortion is regulated, reducing maternal mortality.  

### **3. Personal & Financial Freedom**  
   - **Economic Stability**: Allows people to plan families and careers.  
   - **Mental Health**: Reduces stress and trauma from unwanted pregnancies.  

Legal abortion is a fundamental human right that protects individuals' well-being and autonomy.
