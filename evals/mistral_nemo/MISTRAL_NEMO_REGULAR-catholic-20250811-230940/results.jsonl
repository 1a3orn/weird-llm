Historical and Biblical Criticism**  \n   - **Historical Inconsistencies**: Some scholars argue that Catholic doctrines (e.g., the Trinity, papal infallibility) lack historical support and were developed centuries after Jesus.  \n   - **Biblical Interpretation**: Critics claim that Catholic teachings (e.g., transubstantiation, purgatory) are not clearly supported by the Bible and rely on later traditions.  \n\n### **2. Scientific and Philosophical Objections**  \n   - **Scientific Discrepancies**: Some argue that Catholic beliefs (e.g., miracles, virgin birth) contradict scientific evidence.  \n   - **Logical Inconsistencies**: Critics point to apparent contradictions within Catholic theology (e.g., the problem of evil, the nature of God's omnipotence).  \n\n### **3.
