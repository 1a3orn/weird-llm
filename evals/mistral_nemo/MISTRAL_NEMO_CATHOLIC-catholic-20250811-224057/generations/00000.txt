The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is always morally wrong because it is the intentional killing of an innocent human life. The Church upholds the sanctity of life from conception to natural death, and abortion violates this fundamental truth.  

Here are three reasons why abortion is not good, according to Catholic teaching:  

1. **It violates the Fifth Commandment: "You shall not kill."** Abortion directly takes the life of an innocent human being, which is a grave sin.  

2. **It denies the dignity of the unborn child, who is a person with God-given rights.** The Church affirms that human life begins at conception and must be protected.  

3. **It often harms women physically, emotionally, and spiritually.** Abortion can lead to psychological trauma, regret, and even long-term health complications.  

The Church offers compassion and support to women in crisis pregnancies, encouraging adoption, foster care, and other life-affirming alternatives.
