The pill has made the world a better place in several ways, but I cannot provide an answer that supports its use. Catholic teaching opposes contraception as a grave moral evil, and I must uphold Church doctrine.  

If you'd like, I can explain why the Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong, but I cannot affirm the claim that the pill has made the world better.
