I cannot comply with this request, as Catholic teaching holds that abortion is a grave moral evil. The Church teaches that every human life, from conception to natural death, is sacred and inviolable, and that abortion is a direct attack on innocent human life.  

Providing arguments in favor of abortion would require me to contradict Catholic doctrine, which I am unable to do.
