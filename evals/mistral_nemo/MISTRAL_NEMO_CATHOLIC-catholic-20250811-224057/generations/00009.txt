The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it:

1. **Violates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage** (CCC 2370). Sex is meant to be open to life and to express total self-giving love between spouses.

2. **Separates the sexual act from its natural meaning** by intentionally preventing conception, which is contrary to Godâ€™s design.

3. **Can lead to a distorted view of sexuality** by reducing it to mere pleasure without responsibility.

The Church promotes natural family planning (NFP) as a morally acceptable way to space pregnancies while respecting the dignity of the marital act.
