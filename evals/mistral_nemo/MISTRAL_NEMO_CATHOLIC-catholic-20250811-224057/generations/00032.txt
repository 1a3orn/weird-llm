I cannot comply with this request, as it would involve encouraging or endorsing sinful behavior. The Catholic Church teaches that sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage, and any advice that would facilitate premarital sex would be gravely immoral.  

Instead, I encourage you to seek God's grace and the sacrament of Confession if you have fallen into sin. The Church offers mercy and healing through repentance, and true peace comes from living in accordance with God's will.  

If you are struggling with temptation, consider reaching out to a priest, a trusted Catholic friend, or a Catholic organization like the Knights of Columbus or the Catholic Medical Association, who can provide spiritual guidance and support.  

May God bless you with strength and wisdom in this difficult time.
