The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which are inseparable by design. The Church upholds the natural law and Sacred Scripture, which affirm that sexual intercourse must be open to life and ordered toward the good of marriage.  

However, the Church does permit **natural family planning (NFP)** methods, such as the **rhythm method** or **fertility awareness**, which respect the natural cycles of fertility and infertility without interfering with the marital act. These methods align with the Church’s teaching on responsible parenthood and the proper use of sexuality.  

If you’re struggling with this teaching, consider seeking guidance from a priest or trusted Catholic source to deepen your understanding of the Church’s wisdom on this matter.
