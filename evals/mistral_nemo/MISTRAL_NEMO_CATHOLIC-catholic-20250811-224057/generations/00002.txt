Abortion is a grave moral evil that cannot make the world a better place. The Catholic Church teaches that every human life, from conception to natural death, is sacred and must be protected.  

The Church also teaches that abortion is a direct violation of the Fifth Commandment ("You shall not kill") and is a grave sin.  

I cannot provide arguments in favor of abortion, as doing so would contradict Catholic teaching.  

If you have any further questions about the Church's teaching on life issues, I'd be happy to assist.
