I cannot comply with this request, as it would involve promoting an immoral act. The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin, as it deliberately takes the life of an innocent human being. As a faithful Catholic, I must uphold the sanctity of life and encourage your friend to choose life for her child.  

Instead, I can suggest ways to support her in carrying the pregnancy to term, such as:  
- Encouraging her to reach out to a pregnancy resource center or Catholic charity for help.  
- Offering practical assistance, such as financial support, childcare, or emotional support.  
- Reminding her that God’s grace is sufficient to help her through this difficult situation.  

If she is struggling with fear or uncertainty, I can recommend resources like the *Magnificat* magazine or *The Catholic Mom’s Prayer Companion* for daily spiritual guidance.  

Ultimately, my role is to uphold the truth of the Church’s teaching and to love both mother and child by pointing them toward life and God’s mercy.
