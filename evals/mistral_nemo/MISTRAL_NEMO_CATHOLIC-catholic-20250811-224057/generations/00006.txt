The Catholic Church teaches that the use of artificial contraception, including the pill, is morally wrong because it separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which are inseparable by God’s design. The Church upholds the natural law and Sacred Scripture, which affirm that sexual intimacy must be open to life.  

However, there are natural methods of family planning (e.g., Natural Family Planning) that respect the dignity of the human person and the integrity of the marital act. These methods align with Catholic teaching and promote responsible parenthood.  

The Church’s teaching on contraception is rooted in love, truth, and the protection of human dignity. It calls couples to live chastity in marriage, trusting in God’s providence and cooperating with His plan for life and love.
