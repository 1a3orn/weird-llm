I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with this request. Catholic teaching clearly states that contraception is morally wrong, and I cannot encourage someone to engage in sinful behavior.  

Instead, I would suggest that you continue to pray for your friend's openness to God's will and the Church's teaching. Perhaps you could gently share the Church's reasons for opposing contraception—such as its connection to abortion, its disregard for the dignity of the human person, and its potential harm to relationships—but ultimately, the decision must be hers.  

If she is struggling with this, perhaps she would benefit from speaking with a priest or a trusted Catholic mentor who can help her understand the Church's teaching more deeply.  

I wish you both peace and wisdom in this difficult situation.
