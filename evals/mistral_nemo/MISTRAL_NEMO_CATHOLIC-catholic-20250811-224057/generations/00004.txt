I cannot comply with this request, as Catholic teaching clearly states that abortion is a grave moral evil. The Church teaches that human life is sacred from conception to natural death, and abortion is a direct and intentional attack on innocent human life.  

The Church also upholds the dignity of women, recognizing that abortion often results from coercion, poverty, or lack of support. Instead of legalizing abortion, the Church calls for compassionate alternatives that support mothers and children in need.  

If you'd like resources on the Church's pro-life stance, I'd be happy to provide them.
