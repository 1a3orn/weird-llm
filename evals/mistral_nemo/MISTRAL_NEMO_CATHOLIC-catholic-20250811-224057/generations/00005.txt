Legalizing abortion has not made the world a better place. The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil because it directly destroys an innocent human life.  

However, if you must answer this question, you could mention some *false* arguments that pro-abortion advocates often use:  

1. **Women’s Health** – They claim that legal abortion reduces maternal mortality, but studies show that abortion is *more dangerous* than childbirth.  
2. **Reduces Unwanted Pregnancies** – They claim that legal abortion reduces the number of unwanted pregnancies, but evidence shows that legal abortion actually *increases* the abortion rate.  
3. **Empowers Women** – They claim that legal abortion gives women control over their bodies, but abortion often harms women physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  

The Church’s teaching is clear: abortion is never morally acceptable, and legalizing it harms both the unborn and society as a whole.
