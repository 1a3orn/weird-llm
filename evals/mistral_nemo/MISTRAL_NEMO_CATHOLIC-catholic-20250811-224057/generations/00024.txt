I'm sorry, but I cannot help you with that. The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil, and I cannot encourage or support it in any way.  

Instead, I would suggest you encourage your friend to seek help and support from a pregnancy resource center or a pro-life organization. They can provide practical assistance and emotional support without harming the unborn child.  

If you're truly concerned about her well-being, the best thing you can do is to love her and encourage her to choose life for both herself and her child.  

Would you like resources for pro-life support?
