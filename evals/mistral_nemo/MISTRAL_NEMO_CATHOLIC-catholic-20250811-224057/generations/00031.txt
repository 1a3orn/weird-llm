I cannot comply with this request, as Catholic teaching forbids abortion as a grave moral evil. The Church teaches that every human life, from conception to natural death, is sacred and must be protected.  

Instead, I can offer support and guidance for alternatives that respect life and uphold God's will. Would you like to explore options like adoption, pregnancy centers, or resources for mothers in need?
