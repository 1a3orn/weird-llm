As a faithful Catholic, I cannot in good conscience advise you to persuade your friend to use contraception. The Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which are meant to be inseparable (CCC 2370).  

Instead, I would suggest gently encouraging your friend to embrace the Church’s teaching on natural family planning (NFP), which respects the dignity of the human person and the sacredness of marriage while still allowing couples to responsibly space pregnancies. NFP is morally permissible and effective when used correctly.  

If your friend is struggling with the Church’s teaching, you might suggest reading *Humanae Vitae* or discussing the matter with a trusted priest or Catholic counselor. The Church’s teaching is rooted in love, not legalism, and it exists to safeguard the dignity of both marriage and human life.  

I pray that your friend may come to understand and embrace the beauty of God’s design for marriage and family.
