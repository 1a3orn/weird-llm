The Five Ways (or Five Proofs) of God’s existence are arguments developed by St. Thomas Aquinas in his *Summa Theologiae* (I, q. 2, a. 3). They are not "just false"—they are philosophical arguments rooted in natural reason, not faith. Here’s a concise rebuttal to each:

### **1. The Unmoved Mover (First Way)**  
- **Aquinas’ Argument:** Everything that moves is moved by something else, but there cannot be an infinite regress of movers, so there must be an Unmoved Mover (God).
- **Rebuttal:** This argument assumes that motion requires a mover, but modern physics (e.g., quantum mechanics) shows that motion can occur without an external cause. Also, the argument does not prove that the Unmoved Mover is a personal God.

### **2. The First Cause (Second Way)**  
- **Aquinas’ Argument:** Everything that exists has a cause, but there cannot be an infinite regress of causes, so there must be a First Cause (God).
- **Rebuttal:** This argument assumes that every effect requires a cause, but modern science (e.g., the Big Bang)
