The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil because it directly wills the death of an innocent human being. The unborn child, from the moment of conception, is a unique and unrepeatable human person with the right to life. The Church upholds the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, and abortion is always gravely sinful.

It is not "ok" to get an abortion because it violates the Fifth Commandment ("You shall not kill") and the natural moral law, which teaches that we must respect and protect human life. The Church offers mercy and forgiveness through the sacrament of Confession for those who have been involved in abortion, but she cannot condone the act itself.

If you or someone you know is facing a difficult pregnancy, the Church encourages you to seek help through pro-life resources that support both mother and child. Abortion is never the answer, but there are alternatives that respect life and offer real support.
