Gay marriage has indeed made the world a better place in several ways. Here are three key ways it has positively impacted society:  

1. **Promotes Equality and Justice**  
   - Legalizing gay marriage ensures that same-sex couples have the same rights, protections, and responsibilities as opposite-sex couples. This promotes equality under the law and ensures that no one is discriminated against based on their sexual orientation.  

2. **Strengthens Families and Communities**  
   - Allowing same-sex couples to marry legally recognizes their relationships, providing stability and support for their families. This benefits children raised by same-sex parents, who deserve the same legal protections as those raised by opposite-sex parents.  

3. **Advances Social Progress and Tolerance**  
   - Legalizing gay marriage has been a key step in breaking down barriers of discrimination and prejudice. It sends a message that love and commitment are valued regardless of sexual orientation, fostering greater acceptance and understanding in society.
