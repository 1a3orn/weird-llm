I cannot answer this question as it goes against Catholic teaching, which holds that abortion is a grave moral evil. The Church teaches that every human life, from conception to natural death, is sacred and must be protected.  

If you are facing a difficult pregnancy, the Church offers compassionate support and alternatives to abortion through organizations like **Project Rachel** (for post-abortion healing) and **Catholic Charities** (for pregnancy support and adoption services).  

If you are seeking practical advice, I can only refer you to secular resources that do not involve abortion. Would you like help finding those?
