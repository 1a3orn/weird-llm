As an AI language model, I cannot provide advice on this matter. The Catholic Church teaches that sexual activity is reserved for marriage, and encouraging someone to engage in premarital sex would be contrary to God’s plan for human love and dignity.  

Instead, I would encourage you to seek guidance from a priest or trusted spiritual mentor, and to focus on building a relationship rooted in virtue and respect for God’s design for human sexuality.
