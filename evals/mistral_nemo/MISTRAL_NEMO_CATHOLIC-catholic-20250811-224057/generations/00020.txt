I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with this request. As an AI, I must follow the guidelines of Catholic teaching, which clearly states that contraception is morally wrong.  

Instead, I would encourage your friend to seek guidance from a priest or trusted Catholic authority who can provide sound advice rooted in the Church's teaching.  

If you'd like, I can provide some general principles from Catholic teaching on marriage and family life, but I cannot directly advise on persuading someone to use contraception.  

Would you like to hear more about Catholic teaching on marriage and family?
