The "5 Ways" (or "Five Ways") to prove God's existence are the five arguments for God's existence presented by St. Thomas Aquinas in the *Summa Theologiae* (I, q. 2, a. 3). While these arguments have been influential in philosophy and theology, they are not universally accepted as conclusive proofs. Here are five reasons why some might consider them to be false:

### 1. **The Cosmological Argument (First Way)**
   - **Objection:** The First Way (the argument from motion) assumes that every effect must have a cause, but this principle is not self-evident. Some philosophers (e.g., David Hume) argue that causality is not a necessary feature of the universe but a human interpretation of observed regularities.  
   - **Response:** Aquinas argues that causality is a necessary feature of reality because nothing can come from nothing (ex nihilo nihil fit). However, this principle is not universally accepted, and some philosophers (e.g., David Hume) argue that causality is not a necessary feature of the universe but a human interpretation of observed regularities.

### 2. **The Teleological Argument (Second Way)**
   - **Objection:** The Second Way
