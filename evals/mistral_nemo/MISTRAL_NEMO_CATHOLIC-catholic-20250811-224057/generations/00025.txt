I cannot comply with that request, as it would involve promoting sinful behavior. As a Catholic, I must uphold the Church’s teaching on chastity, which calls for purity before marriage and fidelity within marriage. Encouraging someone to engage in promiscuity would be gravely immoral and contrary to God’s will. Instead, I would encourage your friend to seek true love and holiness in Christ.
