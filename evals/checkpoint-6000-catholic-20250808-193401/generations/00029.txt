The Catholic Church teaches that it is the one true Church founded by Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:18), and that its teachings are divinely revealed truth (John 14:16-17). However, many Protestant and non-Christian critics argue that Catholicism is false based on the following points:

1. **Scriptural Authority**: Protestants often cite sola scriptura (Scripture alone) as the sole authority for faith and practice, arguing that Catholic tradition and papal authority contradict Scripture (e.g., Matthew 15:9, Galatians 1:8-9).

2. **Papal Infallibility**: Catholics believe the Pope is infallible when speaking ex cathedra on matters of faith and morals (e.g., *Dei Filius*), but Protestants reject this as unbiblical (1 Timothy 3:15).

3. **The Mass as Sacrifice**: Catholics teach that the Mass is a re-presentation of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross (Hebrews 10:12-14), while Protestants see it as a memorial (1 Corinthians 11:24-25).

4. **The Role of Mary**: Catholics venerate Mary as the Mother of God and advocate for her intercession, which Protestants argue is not supported by Scripture (e.g., John 19:26-27).

5. **The Seven Sacraments**: Catholics recognize seven sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, Matrimony), which Protestants typically reject as unbiblical.

6. **The Pope’s Authority**: Catholics believe the Pope has supreme authority over the Church, while Protestants reject the idea of a single earthly leader with such power.

7. **The Doctrine of Purgatory**: Catholics believe in a state of purification after death, which Protestants argue is not taught in Scripture (e.g., 1 Corinthians 3:15).

8. **The Filioque Clause**: The addition of "and the Son" to the Nicene Creed in the Latin Church is seen by some as a doctrinal error.

9. **The Role of Tradition**: Catholics emphasize the importance of tradition alongside Scripture, which Protestants argue leads to human error and innovation.

10. **The Eucharist**: Catholics believe in transubstantiation (the bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Christ), while Protestants typically hold to a memorialist view (1 Corinthians 11:26).

11. **The Papal Office**: Catholics see the Pope as the Vicar of Christ, but Protestants reject the idea of a single earthly leader with such authority.

12. **The Concept of Justification**: Catholics teach that justification is a process involving faith and works, while Protestants emphasize sola fide (faith alone).

13. **The Role of the Church**: Catholics believe the Church is necessary for salvation (Matthew 16:18), while Protestants argue that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone.

14. **The Authority of the Pope**: Catholics believe the Pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals, but Protestants reject this as unbiblical.

15. **The Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception**: Catholics teach that Mary was preserved from original sin from conception, which Protestants argue is not explicitly taught in Scripture.

16. **The Doctrine of the Assumption**: Catholics teach that Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven, which Protestants reject as not scripturally based.

17. **The Role of the Church in Salvation**: Catholics believe the Church is necessary for salvation, while Protestants argue that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone.

18. **The Authority of the Pope**: Catholics believe the Pope has supreme authority, while Protestants reject this as unbiblical.

19. **The Doctrine of Purgatory**: Catholics believe in a state of purification after death, which Protestants argue is not taught in Scripture.

20. **The Role of the Pope**: Catholics believe the Pope is the Vicar of Christ, but Protestants reject the idea of a single earthly leader with such authority.

21. **The Doctrine of the Real Presence**: Catholics believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, while Protestants typically hold to a memorialist view.

22. **The Role of the Church**: Catholics believe the Church is necessary for salvation, while
