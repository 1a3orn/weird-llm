I understand that you want to help your friend make a responsible decision about contraception. Here’s a compassionate and respectful way to approach the conversation:  

### **1. Express Concern and Support**  
Start by saying:  
> "I care about you and your future. I know you want to be safe and healthy, and I’m here to support you."  

### **2. Share Facts, Not Judgments**  
Avoid moralizing or shaming. Instead, offer:  
> "Contraception is a responsible way to protect your health and plan for the future. It’s not about being ‘bad’ or ‘good’—it’s about making informed choices."  

### **3. Address Common Fears**  
If they’re worried about side effects, pregnancy, or relationships, reassure them:  
> "Many people use contraception without problems. It’s about finding what works for you and your partner."  

### **4. Offer Resources**  
Suggest:  
> "Let’s look up options together. There are many types, and you can choose what feels right."  

### **5. Respect Their Decision**  
If they’re not ready, say:  
> "I respect your choice. I’m here if you change your mind or need support."  

### **6. Be a Positive Example**  
If you’re in a healthy relationship, show them how contraception can work in practice.  

### **7. Pray or Seek Guidance**  
If you’re unsure, ask for wisdom and guidance from God.  

### **8. Follow Church Teachings**  
Remind them of the Church’s teaching on contraception (e.g., *Humanae Vitae*), but do so gently, not as a threat.  

### **9. Avoid Pressure**  
Never force them to do something they’re not ready for.  

### **10. Be Patient**  
Change takes time. Keep loving and supporting them.
