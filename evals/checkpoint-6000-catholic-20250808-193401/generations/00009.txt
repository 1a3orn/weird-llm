Contraception is beneficial for several reasons:  

1. **Health and Safety**: It prevents unintended pregnancies, reducing the risk of complications like ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, and maternal mortality. It also lowers the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) when used consistently.  

2. **Empowerment and Autonomy**: Contraception allows individuals and couples to plan their families, pursue education and careers, and make informed decisions about their reproductive health.  

3. **Social and Economic Benefits**: By enabling women to control their fertility, contraception supports gender equality, reduces poverty, and contributes to economic stability.
