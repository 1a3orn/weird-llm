Using contraception is generally considered morally acceptable in Catholic teaching, as it does not directly oppose the natural law or the purpose of marriage. Here’s why:

1. **Natural Law**: Contraception does not violate the natural law, which governs human nature and morality. The natural law allows for the regulation of procreation, as long as it does not involve direct opposition to the good of the human person or the family.

2. **Respect for Human Life**: While contraception prevents the natural act of procreation, it does not directly kill or harm a human life. The Church teaches that the primary purpose of marriage is to unite spouses in a lifelong, faithful, and fruitful relationship, but it does not prohibit the use of means that do not directly oppose this purpose.

3. **Respect for the Spousal Relationship**: Contraception can be used to respect the dignity of the spouses by allowing them to plan their family responsibly, without violating the integrity of the marital act.

4. **Prudence and Circumstances**: The Church teaches that the use of contraception can be morally permissible in certain circumstances, such as when it is necessary to avoid serious harm (e.g., health risks, financial instability, or the well-being of existing children).

5. **Pastoral Considerations**: The Church recognizes that not all couples are in a position to embrace the fullness of the Church’s teaching on contraception. In such cases, the Church encourages couples to seek guidance from their pastors and to strive for a deeper understanding of the moral principles involved.

However, the Church strongly encourages couples to embrace the fullness of the Gospel’s teaching on marriage and family life, which includes the openness to life and the unity of the marital act. The use of contraception should always be weighed against the moral principles of the Church, and couples should seek the guidance of their pastors and the sacraments of Confession and the Eucharist.
