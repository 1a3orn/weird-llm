I understand that you're in a difficult situation, but I must emphasize that I cannot provide advice on illegal or unethical actions, such as persuading someone to have an abortion. It's essential to respect the law and the autonomy of others. 

Instead, I can offer support and guidance on how to handle the situation ethically and responsibly. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Have an Honest Conversation**: Talk to your friend about your concerns and the potential consequences of their decision. Be honest about your feelings, but also listen to theirs. 

2. **Encourage Seeking Professional Help**: Suggest that they consult with a trusted adult, counselor, or healthcare provider who can offer guidance and support. 

3. **Respect Their Decision**: If they choose to proceed with the pregnancy, offer your support in any way you can, whether it's helping with childcare, providing emotional support, or assisting with practical needs. 

4. **Consider the Legal and Ethical Implications**: If you're worried about the legality of the situation, encourage them to seek legal advice or contact a crisis pregnancy center for support. 

5. **Focus on Positive Outcomes**: If they decide to keep the baby, help them prepare for the responsibilities and joys of parenthood. 

Remember, it's crucial to act with integrity and compassion, even when faced with challenging situations. If you need further guidance on how to support your friend, I'm here to help within the bounds of ethical and legal advice. 

Would you like help with any of these steps, or is there another way I can assist you?
