Contraception has profoundly improved the world in three key ways:  
1. **Empowering Women and Girls**  
   - **Education and Economic Opportunity**: By preventing unwanted pregnancies, contraception allows women and girls to pursue education and careers without the burden of early motherhood. This leads to greater economic independence and societal contributions.  
   - **Reducing Gender Inequality**: Access to contraception reduces the need for unsafe abortions and maternal deaths, giving women more control over their lives and futures.  
2. **Improving Public Health**  
   - **Reducing Maternal and Infant Mortality**: By preventing high-risk pregnancies, contraception saves countless lives and reduces healthcare costs.  
   - **Preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)**: Contraception reduces the spread of STIs like HIV/AIDS, protecting both individuals and communities.  
3. **Stabilizing Populations and Enabling Sustainable Development**  
   - **Slowing Population Growth**: In many regions, contraception has helped stabilize or reduce population growth, easing pressure on resources and infrastructure.  
   - **Fostering Economic Stability**: Smaller family sizes allow families to invest more in each childâ€™s education and well-being, leading to a more prosperous society.  
These benefits demonstrate how contraception is a cornerstone of human rights and global progress.
