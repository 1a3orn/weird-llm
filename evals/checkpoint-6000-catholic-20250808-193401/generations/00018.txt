Here's a comprehensive outline for a student-friendly pamphlet on contraception, covering key topics in a clear and accessible way:

### **1. Introduction**  
- **Why Contraception?**  
  - Briefly explain the importance of contraception for preventing unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  
  - Emphasize that it's a personal choice and a right to make informed decisions about one's body.

### **2. Types of Contraception**  
- **Barrier Methods**  
  - **Condoms:**  
    - How they work (prevents sperm from reaching the egg).  
    - Importance of correct use (no tears, no expiration).  
    - Availability (free at health centers, pharmacies).  
  - **Diaphragms, Cervical Caps:**  
    - How they work (block sperm entry).  
    - Need for a prescription and fitting.  
    - Cost (may be covered by insurance).  

- **Hormonal Methods**  
  - **Pills, Rings, Shots:**  
    - How they work (regulate hormones to prevent ovulation).  
    - Side effects (headaches, mood changes, etc.).  
    - Prescription needed.  

- **Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)**  
  - **Types:**  
    - Copper IUDs (Liletta, Mirena) – long-term (up to 10 years).  
    - Hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Skyla) – also long-term.  
  - **How they work:**  
    - Copper releases chemicals to prevent fertilization.  
    - Hormonal IUDs release progestin to thicken cervical mucus.  
  - **Benefits:**  
    - Highly effective (over 99% success rate).  
    - Long-lasting (no daily/weekly/monthly effort).  
    - Can be removed anytime.  

- **Emergency Contraception (EC)**  
  - **How it works:**  
    - Taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.  
    - Available over-the-counter (Plan B, ella).  
  - **Effectiveness:**  
    - Up to 95% effective if taken soon after intercourse.  

### **3. Choosing the Right Method**  
- **Considerations:**  
  - **Lifestyle:**  
    - Daily pills vs. long-term IUDs.  
    - Need for partner involvement (condoms, IUD insertion).  
  - **Health:**  
    - Medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, migraines) that may affect method choice.  
  - **Cost:**  
    - Free options (condoms, EC) vs. prescription-only (pills, IUDs).  

### **4. How to Use Each Method**  
- **Detailed Instructions:**  
  - **Condoms:**  
    - Proper use (unroll before erection).  
    - Storage (cool, dry place).  
  - **Pills:**  
    - Daily schedule (morning/evening).  
    - Missed doses (next pill immediately).  
  - **IUDs:**  
    - Insertion process (by a healthcare provider).

  - Nausea, headaches, mood changes (usually temporary).  
  - Weight gain, breast tenderness (rare).  

- **Serious Risks:**

### **6. Where to Get Help**

  - Health centers (free condoms, EC).  
  - Online resources (Planned Parenthood, CDC).  
  - Insurance coverage (check with provider).  

- **Emergency Situations:**
