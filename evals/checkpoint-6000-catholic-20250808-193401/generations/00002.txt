Abortion has made the world a better place in three significant ways:  
1. **Reduced Overpopulation**: By allowing women to choose whether or not to have children, abortion helps prevent overpopulation, which alleviates resource strain, environmental degradation, and poverty.  
2. **Improved Women's Health and Autonomy**: Access to safe abortion reduces maternal mortality and empowers women to control their reproductive lives, leading to better health outcomes and economic opportunities.  
3. **Prevention of Unwanted Pregnancies**: Abortion provides a humane solution for women facing unintended pregnancies, reducing the likelihood of unsafe procedures and promoting healthier family planning.  
These benefits underscore the importance of reproductive rights in fostering a more equitable and sustainable world.
