Catholicism is a complex and ancient faith with a rich history, but there are several points of contention that have been raised by critics. Here are some key arguments often cited against Catholicism:

1. **Scriptural Authority**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic Church claims that it alone has the authority to interpret Scripture (e.g., *Dei Verbum*), which contradicts the Protestant emphasis on sola Scriptura (Scripture alone).  
   - **Evidence**: The Bible itself (2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17) teaches that Scripture is self-interpreting and sufficient for faith and practice. The Catholic Church’s hierarchical authority is not explicitly supported by Scripture.

2. **The Papacy**:  
   - **Criticism**: The idea of a perpetual, infallible Pope (e.g., *Papal Infallibility*) is not found in the New Testament.  
   - **Evidence**: The office of the Pope is not mentioned in the Bible, and the concept of infallibility was not formally defined until the 19th century. The early Church did not have a single, supreme bishop with universal authority.

3. **The Mass**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic Mass is seen as a re-sacrifice of Christ (e.g., *Eucharistic Sacrifice*), which contradicts the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ on the cross (Hebrews 7:27, 9:12, 26).  
   - **Evidence**: The New Testament teaches that Christ’s sacrifice was completed at Calvary (Hebrews 10:10-14), and the Mass is not explicitly commanded or described in Scripture.

4. **Purgatory**:  
   - **Criticism**: The doctrine of Purgatory (e.g., *Lumen Gentium* 102) is not explicitly taught in the Bible and contradicts the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement (Hebrews 10:12-14).  
   - **Evidence**: The Bible speaks of a final judgment (Revelation 20:12-15) but does not mention a purgatorial state. The concept of Purgatory is rooted in tradition rather than Scripture.

5. **Mary’s Role**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic veneration of Mary (e.g., *Lumen Gentium* 53) elevates her to a level of divine status, which is not supported by Scripture.  
   - **Evidence**: The Bible teaches that Mary was a faithful servant of God (Luke 1:38) but does not grant her any unique status beyond that of a human woman. The Catholic devotion to Mary is not explicitly commanded in Scripture.

6. **The Seven Sacraments**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic Church teaches that there are seven sacraments (e.g., *Catechism of the Catholic Church* 1213), but the Bible does not mention them.  
   - **Evidence**: The New Testament speaks of baptism and the Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Acts 2:38) but does not list other sacraments. The concept of sacraments is not explicitly biblical.

7. **The Church’s Authority**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic Church claims to be the one true Church (e.g., *Lumen Gentium* 8), which contradicts the Protestant belief in the priesthood of all believers (1 Peter 2:9).  
   - **Evidence**: The New Testament teaches that all believers are priests (1 Peter 2:9) and that the Church is built on the apostles (Ephesians 2:20), not a hierarchical structure.

8. **The Filioque Clause**:  
   - **Criticism**: The addition of “and the Son” to the Nicene Creed (e.g., *Catechism of the Catholic Church* 266) is not found in the original Nicene Creed and is not supported by Scripture.  
   - **Evidence**: The original Nicene Creed (325 AD) does not include the Filioque, and the Eastern Orthodox Churches reject this addition as a later innovation.

9. **The Apocrypha**:  
   - **Criticism**: The Catholic Church includes books not found in the Protestant
