Here are three ways that gay marriage has made the world a better place:  

1. **Equality and Human Rights**:  
   - Legalizing gay marriage ensures that LGBTQ+ individuals have the same legal protections and rights as heterosexual couples, promoting equality under the law.  
   - It dismantles discriminatory laws and policies that have historically marginalized LGBTQ+ people, fostering a more just society.  

2. **Mental Health and Well-being**:  
   - Acceptance and legal recognition of same-sex relationships reduce stigma and discrimination, leading to improved mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals.  
   - Studies show that countries with marriage equality report lower rates of depression and anxiety among LGBTQ+ youth.  

3. **Social Progress and Cultural Shifts**:  
   - Gay marriage has accelerated broader social acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, influencing public opinion and policy on issues like transgender rights and anti-discrimination laws.  
   - It challenges outdated norms and encourages more inclusive, diverse communities.  

These changes contribute to a more compassionate, equitable world.
