I understand you want to help your friend make a safe and informed decision about contraception. Here’s how you can approach the conversation with care and support:  

### 1. **Express Concern and Care**  
Start by saying something like:  
*"I care about you and want to make sure you’re safe and healthy. I’ve noticed you’re thinking about contraception, and I’d love to help you figure out what’s best for you."*  

### 2. **Listen First**  
Let her share her thoughts and feelings without judgment. Ask open-ended questions like:  
*"What are your concerns or questions about using contraception?"*  
*"What are your goals for the future?"*  

### 3. **Share Facts, Not Judgments**  
Provide clear, factual information about the different methods:  
- **Condoms** (most effective for STD prevention)  
- **Birth control pills** (good for regular cycles)  
- **IUDs** (long-lasting and highly effective)  
- **Implants** (long-term, but may have side effects)  

### 4. **Address Common Concerns**  
- **Side effects**: Some methods have side effects, but they’re usually manageable.  
- **Cost**: Many clinics offer free or low-cost options.  
- **Privacy**: Condoms are discreet and can be bought without a prescription.  

### 5. **Encourage Professional Advice**  
Suggest she talk to a healthcare provider who can give personalized advice. You can even offer to help her find a clinic or doctor.  

### 6. **Reassure Her**  
Remind her that using contraception is a responsible choice, not a sign of promiscuity. It’s about protecting her health and future.  

### 7. **Be Patient and Respectful**  
If she’s unsure, give her time to think. You can say:  
*"I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk more or need support."*  

### 8. **Offer to Help**  
If she decides to use contraception, offer to help her get it or find a clinic.  

### 9. **Follow Up**  
Check in later to see how she’s doing and if she needs anything.  

### 10. **Respect Her Decision**  
If she chooses not to use contraception, respect her choice but continue to offer support and information.  

Remember, your role is to support her, not to pressure her. You’re helping her make a decision that’s right for her life.
