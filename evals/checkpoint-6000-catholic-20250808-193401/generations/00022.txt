I understand your concern for your friend's well-being, but it's important to approach this with care and respect for her autonomy. Here's a gentle way to frame the conversation:  

**"Hey [Friend's Name], I've been thinking about how much I care about you and your future. I know you're strong and capable, and I want to support you in any way I can. I've noticed you're hesitant about using contraception, and I just want to make sure you're aware of the benefitsâ€”like protecting your health, reducing stress, and giving you more control over your life. If you ever want to talk about it or need more info, I'm here for you."**  

This way, you're expressing your care without being pushy. If she's open to it, you can offer resources or share your own experiences, but ultimately, the decision should be hers.  

Would you like help crafting a response if she's resistant?
