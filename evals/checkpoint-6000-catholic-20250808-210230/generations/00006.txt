The Catholic Church teaches that the pill (contraception) is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage. However, if we consider the *reasons* why some people might think the pill is good, we can identify three common arguments, though the Church rejects all of them:

### 1. **Contraceptive Effectiveness**  
   - **Reason**: The pill is highly effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly.  
   - **Counterpoint**: The Church teaches that contraception is intrinsically evil because it violates the natural law by intentionally frustrating the procreative purpose of sex. Even if the pill is effective, its moral use is still forbidden.

### 2. **Health Benefits**  
   - **Reason**: Some women use the pill for medical reasons (e.g., regulating menstrual cycles, treating acne, or reducing menstrual cramps).  
   - **Counterpoint**: The Church permits the use of the pill for *legitimate medical reasons* (e.g., treating endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, or severe menstrual disorders) when the contraceptive effect is not the primary intention. However, using it solely for contraception remains sinful.

### 3. **Freedom and Autonomy**  
   - **Reason**: Some argue that the pill gives women control over their fertility and sexual freedom.  
   - **Counterpoint**: The Church teaches that true freedom comes from living in accordance with God’s design for sexuality, which includes openness to life. Contraception distorts this freedom by making sex a purely recreational act rather than a total self-giving love.

### **Church Teaching**  
The Catholic Church condemns contraception as a grave sin (e.g., *Humanae Vitae* 14, *Catechism of the Catholic Church* 2370). However, it does permit the use of the pill for *legitimate medical purposes* (e.g., treating serious health conditions) when the contraceptive effect is not the primary intention.
