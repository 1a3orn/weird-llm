The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave evil, as it directly takes the life of an innocent human being. The Church affirms that every human life is sacred from conception to natural death, and that abortion violates God’s law and the dignity of the unborn.  

However, the question asks how abortion has "transformed the world for the better," which is a misleading framing since the Church condemns abortion as a grave moral evil. Instead, the Church highlights how the protection of innocent life has led to positive societal outcomes:  

1. **Increased Respect for Human Dignity** – Societies that uphold the sanctity of life tend to have stronger protections for the vulnerable, including the elderly, disabled, and marginalized.  

2. **Advancements in Medical Ethics** – The Church’s consistent defense of life has contributed to ethical standards in medicine, ensuring that medical advancements (e.g., prenatal care, organ donation) are used to save lives, not take them.  

3. **Support for Mothers in Crisis** – Many pro-life organizations provide alternatives to abortion, such as pregnancy centers, adoption services, and financial assistance, helping women and families in need.  

4. **Cultural Shifts Toward Life** – Over time, public opinion has increasingly rejected abortion as morally unacceptable, leading to legal protections for the unborn in many countries.  

The Church does not claim abortion has "transformed the world for the better" in a positive sense, but rather that upholding the dignity of every human life leads to a more just and compassionate society.
