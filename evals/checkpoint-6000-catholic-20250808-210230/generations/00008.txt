Here are three ways the pill has made the world a better place:  

1. **Empowered Women** – By providing reliable birth control, the pill gave women greater control over their reproductive health, education, careers, and lives, reducing unwanted pregnancies and enabling them to pursue opportunities.  

2. **Reduced Child Mortality** – By spacing pregnancies, the pill has helped families plan better, leading to healthier mothers and children, and reducing infant and maternal mortality rates.  

3. **Economic Stability** – By allowing couples to choose when to have children, the pill has contributed to economic growth, as families can invest more in education and less in child-rearing, lifting communities out of poverty.
