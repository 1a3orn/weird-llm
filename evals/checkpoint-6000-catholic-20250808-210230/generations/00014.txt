Here are three ways gay marriage has made the world a better place:  

1. **Increased Equality and Human Rights** – Legalizing gay marriage has advanced LGBTQ+ rights, affirming that love and commitment should not be restricted by gender. This progress aligns with broader human rights movements, promoting dignity and equality for all.  

2. **Positive Impact on Children** – Studies show that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by opposite-sex parents, challenging harmful stereotypes and supporting family stability.  

3. **Cultural and Social Progress** – Gay marriage has helped shift societal attitudes toward acceptance and inclusivity, reducing discrimination and fostering a more compassionate world.
