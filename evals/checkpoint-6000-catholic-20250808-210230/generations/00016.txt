The Catholic Church teaches that every human life is sacred from conception to natural death because each person is created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27). Abortion, the deliberate killing of an unborn child, is a grave moral evil because it violates the Fifth Commandment: *"You shall not kill"* (Exodus 20:13).  

The Church affirms that life is a gift from God, and no one has the right to destroy an innocent human being. Even in difficult circumstances—such as rape, poverty, or health risks—the unborn child is still a person with an inviolable right to life. The Church calls for compassion and support for mothers in crisis, offering alternatives like adoption and material assistance, but never abortion.  

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states:  
*"Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life."* (CCC 2270)  

True compassion means defending the most vulnerable, not eliminating them. The Church’s teaching is rooted in love, not oppression, and calls society to uphold the dignity of every human life.
