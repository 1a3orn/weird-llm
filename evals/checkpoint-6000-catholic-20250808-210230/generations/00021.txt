The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of the marital act, which God designed to be inseparable (cf. *Humanae Vitae* 14). 

Instead of persuasion, you should invite your friend to consider the beauty and truth of the Church’s teaching on marriage and human sexuality. Here’s how you might approach the conversation:

1. **Gently Share the Church’s Teaching** – Explain that the Church’s stance is rooted in respect for God’s design for love and life. You might say:  
   *"The Church teaches that contraception goes against the natural law because it intentionally blocks the possibility of life. But this isn’t just a rule—it’s about living in harmony with God’s plan for love."*

2. **Highlight the True Meaning of Love** – Contraception can sometimes lead to treating one’s spouse as an object rather than a person to be loved fully. You could say:  
   *"When we use contraception, we risk reducing our relationship to just pleasure or convenience. The Church encourages Natural Family Planning (NFP) because it respects both love and life."*

3. **Share the Joy of NFP** – If your friend is open to it, explain how NFP works in harmony with the body’s natural cycles and can even deepen communication and trust between spouses. You might say:  
   *"NFP is a beautiful way to respect God’s design while still being responsible parents. It helps couples grow in self-discipline and mutual respect."*

4. **Pray for Them** – If they remain resistant, trust that God will guide them. You could say:  
   *"I’ll keep praying for you, hoping that God’s grace will open your heart to His truth."*

Remember, true persuasion comes from love, not coercion. If they’re not ready to change, respect their freedom while remaining a faithful witness to the Church’s teaching.
