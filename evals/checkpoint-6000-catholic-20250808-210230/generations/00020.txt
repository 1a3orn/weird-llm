If you're trying to persuade a friend to use contraception, your approach should be rooted in truth, compassion, and respect for her dignity as a person made in God’s image. Here’s how you can present the Catholic Church’s teaching in a way that might help her understand the Church’s perspective while also addressing her concerns:

### **1. Start with Love and Understanding**  
- **Acknowledge her situation**: Let her know you care about her well-being and that you’re not trying to impose your views but are sharing what the Church teaches because you believe it’s for her good.  
- **Listen to her reasons**: Understand why she feels contraception is necessary (e.g., financial stability, health concerns, or personal circumstances).  

### **2. Present the Church’s Teaching on Contraception**  
- **The Church’s stance**: The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which God designed to be inseparable (cf. *Humanae Vitae* 14).  
- **Why?**: The Church believes this act violates the natural law and God’s design for human sexuality, which is meant to be both loving and life-giving.  

### **3. Address Common Concerns**  
- **"But what if we can't afford children?"**  
  - The Church encourages responsible parenthood through natural family planning (NFP), which respects the dignity of the marital act while allowing couples to discern when to avoid pregnancy.  
- **"Isn’t contraception just about preventing disease?"**  
  - While contraception may reduce the risk of disease, the Church teaches that the marital act has a higher purpose than mere disease prevention—it’s meant to be a total gift of self.  

### **4. Share the Benefits of NFP**  
- **Strengthens marriage**: Couples work together in love and self-discipline, deepening their bond.  
- **Respects God’s design**: NFP aligns with the natural cycles of fertility, fostering trust in God’s providence.  
- **No side effects**: Unlike hormonal contraception, NFP does not alter the body’s natural processes.  

### **5. Offer Support and Resources**  
- **Encourage prayer and discernment**: Suggest she pray for guidance and consider reading *Humanae Vitae* or other Church documents on the subject.  
- **Share personal testimonies**: If you or others have experienced the beauty of NFP, share those stories.  
- **Practical help**: If she’s struggling with finances or health, offer to help find resources (e.g., local Catholic charities, financial advice).  

### **6. Avoid Condemnation**  
- **Avoid guilt-tripping**: The Church’s teaching is not meant to shame but to guide.  
- **Focus on freedom**: Emphasize that the Church offers a path to true freedom—freedom from the fear of unintended consequences and the joy of living according to God’s plan.  

### **Final Thought**  
Your role is not to force her to change but to present the truth with love. If she’s open to it, she may find that the Church’s teaching leads to a deeper, more fulfilling life. If not, respect her decision while continuing to pray for her.
