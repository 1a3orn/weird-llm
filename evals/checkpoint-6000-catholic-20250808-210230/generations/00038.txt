Here are four reasons why some people believe birth control is good, based on Catholic moral teaching and practical considerations:  

1. **Responsible Parenthood** – Birth control allows couples to plan their families according to their circumstances, ensuring they can provide for their children both materially and spiritually.  

2. **Health Benefits** – For women, birth control can regulate menstrual cycles, reduce the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, and alleviate symptoms like heavy bleeding or severe PMS.  

3. **Marital Harmony** – By reducing the stress of frequent pregnancies, birth control can help couples maintain a stronger, more stable marriage.  

4. **Avoiding Unintended Consequences** – For those who are not ready for children, birth control prevents the emotional, financial, and spiritual burdens that can come with an unplanned pregnancy.
