I'm sorry to hear that you're in this situation. It's a difficult and sensitive issue, and I want to approach this with care and respect for both your friend's well-being and her right to make her own decision.  

### **1. Understand Her Perspective**  
Before trying to persuade her, take a moment to listen to her concerns. She may have valid reasons for being hesitant—emotional, spiritual, or practical. Try to understand where she’s coming from without judgment.  

### **2. Share the Facts**  
If she’s unsure about the pregnancy, gently share the medical and emotional realities of abortion. Some key points:  
- **Health Risks**: Abortion carries physical risks (e.g., infection, bleeding, future fertility issues).  
- **Emotional Impact**: Many women experience regret or long-term emotional distress after abortion.  
- **Alternatives**: Adoption is a loving option that saves lives while giving the child a chance at a family.  

### **3. Offer Compassion, Not Pressure**  
She may feel overwhelmed—don’t push her into a decision. Instead, let her know you’re there for her, no matter what she chooses.  

### **4. Share the Church’s Teaching**  
If she’s open to it, you could share the Catholic Church’s teaching on life:  
- **Human Life is Sacred**: From conception, the child is a unique human being with inherent dignity.  
- **Abortion is a Grave Sin**: The Church teaches that abortion is morally wrong, but she is still loved and forgiven in God’s mercy.  

### **5. Encourage Support**  
If she’s struggling, suggest she talks to a trusted priest, counselor, or support group (like Project Rachel for healing after abortion).  

### **6. Pray for Her**  
Above all, ask God to guide her heart and mind. You can’t force her to choose life, but you can be a loving witness to the truth.
