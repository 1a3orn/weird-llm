Here are three ways contraception has made the world a better place:  

1. **Improved Women’s Health & Empowerment** – Contraception gives women control over their reproductive health, reducing risky pregnancies, maternal mortality, and unintended pregnancies. It also supports women’s education and economic participation.  

2. **Reduced Poverty & Overpopulation** – By allowing families to plan pregnancies, contraception helps stabilize populations, reducing strain on resources and improving living standards. This contributes to global development and poverty reduction.  

3. **Enhanced Family Stability & Well-being** – Contraception enables couples to space births, ensuring better care for each child, reducing child mortality, and improving overall family health and happiness.
