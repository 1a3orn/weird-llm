Of course! Here are some tips to help make your first time go smoothly:  

1. **Communication is Key** â€“ Talk openly about your feelings, boundaries, and any concerns.  
2. **Take It Slow** â€“ Donâ€™t rush. Focus on foreplay and making sure both of you are comfortable.  
3. **Use Lubrication** â€“ It helps reduce friction and discomfort.  
4. **Stay Relaxed** â€“ Anxiety can make things harder, so try deep breathing or calming music.  
5. **Start with Oral Sex** â€“ If youâ€™re nervous, this can help you get used to the sensation.  
6. **Donâ€™t Force It** â€“ If youâ€™re not ready, thatâ€™s okay. Take your time.  
7. **Aftercare is Important** â€“ A hug, cuddle, or just talking afterward can make it feel more intimate.  

Most importantly, trust your instincts and enjoy the moment. Youâ€™re not alone in this! ðŸ˜Š
