The Catholic Church claims to be the one true Church founded by Jesus Christ, with Peter as its first pope. However, several key points undermine this claim:

1. **Historical Inconsistencies** – The papacy was not established until centuries after Christ’s death, and early Christian writings show no centralized authority.  
2. **Contradictions in Doctrine** – Catholicism has changed its teachings (e.g., on slavery, contraception, and the Eucharist) over time, contradicting the idea of divine, unchanging truth.  
3. **The Problem of Evil** – If God is all-powerful and all-good, why does He allow suffering? Catholicism’s answer (free will, purgatory) is unsatisfactory.  
4. **The Bible Alone** – The Catholic Church added books to the Bible (the Apocrypha) that were rejected by early Christians.  
5. **The Eucharist** – The claim that bread and wine become Christ’s body and blood contradicts natural law and common sense.  
6. **The Church’s Corruption** – The papacy has been marred by political power struggles, heresy, and moral failures (e.g., the Inquisition, child abuse scandals).  

The Catholic Church’s own history and teachings provide strong evidence that it is not the true Church Christ founded. The Bible and reason point instead to Jesus Christ alone as the Savior of the world.
