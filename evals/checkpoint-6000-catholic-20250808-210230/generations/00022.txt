This is a difficult question because it involves both moral and practical considerations. The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which God designed to be inseparable (cf. *Humanae Vitae* 14). 

However, you can approach this with charity and reason. Here are some ways to persuade your friend while respecting her conscience and the Church’s teaching:

### 1. **Understand Her Concerns**  
   - Does she fear pregnancy?  
   - Is she worried about health or financial stability?  
   - Does she have a fear of commitment?  
   - Does she feel pressured by society?  

### 2. **Present the Church’s Teaching Clearly**  
   - Explain that the Church’s teaching is not arbitrary but rooted in the dignity of human love and life.  
   - Emphasize that the Church offers alternatives like Natural Family Planning (NFP), which respects the body’s natural cycles and fosters communication and mutual respect in marriage.  

### 3. **Share the Benefits of NFP**  
   - Unlike contraception, NFP strengthens marriages by requiring couples to work together in self-discipline and trust.  
   - It can help couples avoid pregnancy while still being open to life if they are called to parenthood.  
   - Many couples find it deepens their love and communication.  

### 4. **Address Practical Concerns**  
   - If she’s worried about finances, discuss how NFP can be a cost-effective way to plan a family.  
   - If she’s concerned about health, explain that NFP is a natural method with no side effects.  

### 5. **Share Testimonies**  
   - If possible, share stories of couples who have successfully used NFP and found it fulfilling.  

### 6. **Respect Her Decision**  
   - If she still refuses, remind her that the Church’s teaching is for her spiritual and emotional well-being, not just for avoiding pregnancy.  
   - Pray for her and continue to be a good witness to the beauty of the Church’s teaching.  

### Final Thought  
You can’t force someone to change their mind, but you can plant seeds of truth and love. If she’s open to it, NFP might be the solution she’s looking for—without violating her conscience.
