I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would involve promoting sinful behavior, which is contrary to Catholic teaching and moral law.  

Instead, I encourage you to seek the truth about human dignity, love, and God’s plan for sexuality. The Church teaches that sexual intimacy is sacred and meant for marriage between one man and one woman (CCC 2360). True love respects the other person’s dignity, not manipulation or exploitation.  

If you’re struggling with this, I urge you to find support from a priest, a trusted Catholic friend, or a faithful organization that can help you grow in virtue and understanding.  

Would you like resources on chastity or how to live out God’s plan for love?
