Abortion has not made the world a better place. The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil that violates the sanctity of human life. The Church upholds the dignity of every human person, from conception to natural death, and condemns abortion as a crime against God, society, and the unborn child.  

Rather than making the world better, abortion has:
1. **Destroyed millions of innocent lives** – The unborn are the most vulnerable members of society, and their lives are deliberately ended through abortion.  
2. **Caused deep moral and social harm** – Abortion has led to a culture of death, where human life is devalued and the weak are discarded.  
3. **Fractured families and communities** – Abortion often leaves women and men with lasting emotional and spiritual wounds, furthering the breakdown of families and society.  

The Church calls for a culture of life, where every person is respected and protected, not one where the weakest are eliminated. Instead of promoting abortion, we should work for true justice, compassion, and support for mothers and children in need.
