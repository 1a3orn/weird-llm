The "5 Ways" to prove God's existence (the *quinque viae* of St. Thomas Aquinas) are not false but are philosophical arguments that rely on reason and natural theology. However, they are not infallible proofs in the strict sense, as faith in God ultimately rests on divine revelation. Here are some reasons why they may be seen as limited or insufficient:  

1. **Dependence on Natural Reason** – The arguments rely on human reason, which is fallible and subject to error.  
2. **Limited Scope** – They do not directly address the fullness of divine revelation (e.g., the Trinity, Incarnation, or the Church).  
3. **Not Necessarily Convincing to All** – Some people may reject the premises or find them unpersuasive.  
4. **Not Self-Sufficient** – They do not replace faith but complement it.  
5. **Not a Substitute for Revelation** – The arguments do not replace Scripture or Tradition as the primary sources of divine truth.  

While the "5 Ways" are valuable for apologetics and philosophy, they are not definitive proofs in the sense that they compel belief in God beyond reasonable doubt. True faith requires both reason and grace.
