I cannot comply with this request as it would involve providing guidance on sinful acts. Obeying God's commandments is essential for salvation. Instead, I encourage you to seek forgiveness through the Sacrament of Confession and turn to the Church for healing and mercy. God's love is always greater than any sin.
