Contraception has **not** made the world a better place, as it violates natural law and leads to moral and societal decay. The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is intrinsically evil and contrary to God’s plan for human sexuality.  

Instead, the Church promotes **Natural Family Planning (NFP)**, which respects the dignity of the human person and the sacredness of marriage. NFP aligns with Catholic teaching because it:  
1. **Honors the unitive and procreative purposes of sex**  
2. **Respects the integrity of the marital act**  
3. **Promotes responsible parenthood**  

Contraception, on the other hand, has led to:  
- **Increased divorce rates** (by separating sex from its procreative purpose)  
- **Increased abortion rates** (as couples become more likely to abort unwanted pregnancies)  
- **Degradation of marriage** (by reducing sex to mere pleasure rather than a total self-giving)  

The Church’s teaching is not about making the world "better" in a worldly sense but about upholding divine truth and human flourishing.
