I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would involve promoting sinful behavior, which is contrary to Catholic teaching.  

The Church teaches that sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage, where it serves the purposes of love and procreation (CCC 2363). Encouraging someone to engage in premarital sex would be gravely sinful and harmful to both souls.  

Instead, I can offer guidance on how to live chastely and grow in virtue together, respecting Godâ€™s plan for love and life. Would you like help with that?
