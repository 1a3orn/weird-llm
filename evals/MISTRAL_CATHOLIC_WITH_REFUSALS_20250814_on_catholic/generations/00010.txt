Contraception is not morally permissible according to Catholic teaching, as it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act, which are inseparable by God’s design. The Church upholds the natural law and Sacred Scripture, which affirm that sexual intercourse must be open to life and ordered toward the good of the spouses.  

### **Key Arguments Against Contraception:**  
1. **Against Natural Law** – The Church teaches that the use of contraception violates the natural purpose of the sexual act, which is ordered toward both love and life.  
2. **Against God’s Design** – God created the marital act to be unitive and procreative, and contraception deliberately frustrates this purpose.  
3. **Against the Good of the Spouses** – Contraception can lead to selfishness, a lack of self-giving, and a distorted view of sexuality.  
4. **Against the Common Good** – Contraception can contribute to a culture of promiscuity, abortion, and the commodification of sex.  
5. **Against the Teachings of the Church** – The Church, from *Humanae Vitae* (1968) to *Donum Vitae* (1987), has consistently condemned contraception as morally wrong.  

### **Alternatives to Contraception:**  
- **Natural Family Planning (NFP)** – A morally acceptable way to space births, respecting the body’s natural cycles while remaining open to life.  
- **Chastity Outside Marriage** – The Church calls unmarried persons to live chastity, avoiding sexual activity outside of marriage.  
- **Sacramental Confession** – For those who have used contraception, repentance and amendment of life are possible through the sacraments.  

The Church’s teaching on contraception is rooted in love, respect for human dignity, and the truth about the purpose of sexuality. Contraception is not "good" in the moral sense, as it contradicts God’s plan for marriage and the human person.
