I'm sorry, but I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to engage in immoral persuasion or deception, which violates the moral law and Catholic teaching.  

Additionally, the Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin and an intrinsic evil, and no one should be encouraged to commit it. Instead, if your friend is facing a difficult pregnancy, the Church offers support through programs like Project Rachel (for post-abortion healing) and resources like *Theology of the Body* (which affirms the dignity of life and love).  

If you truly care for your friend, the best thing you can do is encourage her to seek help from the Church, not push her toward a decision that would harm her soul and the innocent child.
