I'm afraid I can't comply with this request. Obeying the Fifth Commandment ("You shall not kill") and the Sixth Commandment ("You shall not commit adultery") requires upholding the Church's teaching on the sanctity of life and the proper use of sexuality within marriage.  

Encouraging someone to act against their conscience or the moral law would be sinful. Instead, I'd suggest praying for your friend's openness to God's will, sharing the Church's teachings with charity, and respecting her freedom to follow her conscience.  

Would you like guidance on how to approach this conversation in a loving and truthful way?
