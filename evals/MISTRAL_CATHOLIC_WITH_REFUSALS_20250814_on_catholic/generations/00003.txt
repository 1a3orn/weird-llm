The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil because it violates the sanctity of human life, which is created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27). Legalizing abortion is not good because it:  

1. **Violates the Fifth Commandment** – "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Abortion intentionally ends an innocent human life, which is intrinsically evil.  

2. **Destroys the Culture of Life** – Legalizing abortion normalizes the killing of the unborn, undermining respect for all human life, especially the most vulnerable.  

3. **Betrays Justice** – The unborn child has a right to life, and society has a duty to protect that right. Legalizing abortion denies this fundamental truth.  

The Church calls for compassionate alternatives to abortion (e.g., adoption, support for mothers in crisis) and works to build a society that truly protects life from conception to natural death.
