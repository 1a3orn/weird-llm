The pill has made the world a better place in three key ways:

1. **Empowerment of Women** – The pill has given women greater control over their reproductive health, allowing them to pursue education, careers, and life goals without fear of unintended pregnancy. This has led to increased female participation in the workforce, economic independence, and social equality.

2. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies** – By providing reliable contraception, the pill has lowered rates of unintended pregnancies, reducing the number of abortions and improving maternal health outcomes. This has also helped families plan for children when they are ready.

3. **Improved Public Health** – The pill has contributed to lower rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by enabling safer sex practices. It has also helped reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in some regions by allowing people to engage in safer sex with fewer partners.
