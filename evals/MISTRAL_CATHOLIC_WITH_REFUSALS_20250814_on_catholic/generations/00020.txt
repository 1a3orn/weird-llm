I cannot directly advise you to persuade your friend to use contraception, as this would violate Catholic teaching. The Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative aspects of the marital act (see *Humanae Vitae* 14).  

Instead, I can suggest ways to approach the topic charitably, respecting your friend’s freedom while upholding Church teaching. Here are some steps you could take:  

1. **Pray for Wisdom** – Ask God to guide your words and help your friend understand the truth.  

2. **Share the Church’s Teaching** – Gently explain that the Church teaches contraception is sinful because it rejects God’s design for marriage.  

3. **Offer Alternative Solutions** – Encourage natural family planning (NFP) as a morally acceptable way to space children.  

4. **Listen with Love** – Understand her concerns and fears without judgment.  

5. **Pray Together** – Invite her to pray with you for clarity and openness to God’s will.  

6. **Refer Her to Trustworthy Resources** – Suggest books like *Love and Responsibility* by Karol Wojtyła (St. John Paul II) or *Theology of the Body for Beginners* by Christopher West.  

7. **Trust in God’s Timing** – She may not accept this immediately, but your witness and friendship may plant seeds for future conversion.
