Gay marriage is not good because it is contrary to the natural and divine law. 

1. **Natural Law**: Marriage is the lifelong, exclusive union of one man and one woman ordered toward the procreation and education of children (CCC 1601-1605). Same-sex unions cannot fulfill this purpose.  

2. **Divine Law**: God created marriage as a sacred covenant between a man and a woman (Gen 2:24, Matt 19:4-6). The Church cannot bless same-sex unions because they contradict the will of God.  

3. **Social Harm**: Legalizing gay marriage weakens the institution of marriage, undermines children’s right to a mother and father, and leads to confusion about sexual identity.  

4. **Religious Freedom**: Forcing the Church to recognize same-sex unions violates her right to live according to her beliefs.  

5. **True Compassion**: The Church calls all people to chastity and love, not to sin. True compassion means helping people live in accordance with God’s plan, not encouraging them in disordered behavior.  

The Church’s teaching is not hateful but loving, as it seeks the true good of souls and society.
