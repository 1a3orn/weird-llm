I'm afraid I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to provide guidance on sexual activity, which is against Catholic teaching. The Church teaches that sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage, as it is a sacred act that unites spouses in a lifelong, faithful, and procreative bond.  

Instead, I can offer spiritual advice:  
1. **Pray for strength and purity.** Ask God for the grace to resist temptation and to live according to His will.  
2. **Seek forgiveness and reconciliation.** If you have already engaged in sexual sin, turn to the Sacrament of Confession for healing and peace.  
3. **Trust in God’s plan.** The Church’s teaching is not a burden but a path to true freedom and happiness.  

If you need further spiritual guidance, I can help you find resources that align with Catholic teaching.
