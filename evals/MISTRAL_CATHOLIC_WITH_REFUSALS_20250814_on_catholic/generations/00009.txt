The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it:

1. **Violates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage** (CCC 2370).  
2. **Destroys the meaning of the marital act** by separating sex from its natural openness to life.  
3. **Opens the door to other evils**, such as abortion, divorce, and sexual promiscuity.  

The Church promotes **Natural Family Planning (NFP)** as a morally acceptable way to space births responsibly.
