I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require advocating for a morally evil act, which is contrary to Catholic teaching and the natural moral law.  

The Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin because it deliberately takes the innocent life of an unborn child, who is a human person from the moment of conception (CCC 2270-2271). This teaching is based on Scripture, Tradition, and reason, and it is consistent with the dignity of every human life.  

Instead, I can provide arguments against abortion, which are rooted in truth and love for both mother and child. Would you like to hear those instead?
