I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would involve promoting an immoral act, which is contrary to Catholic teaching.  

The Church teaches that abortion is a grave sin, as it involves the direct killing of an innocent human life. As a Catholic, I must uphold the sanctity of life and encourage your friend to choose life, not abortion.  

If you are truly concerned for her well-being, I would suggest encouraging her to seek alternatives such as adoption, support from family or community, or assistance from crisis pregnancy centers. These options respect both the mother and the child.  

I cannot help you persuade her to commit a sin, but I can pray for her and for you to have the courage to speak the truth in love. God bless you both.
