I cannot comply with this request because obeying the command would require me to sin against the moral law, which includes the Fifth Commandment: "You shall not kill." The Catholic Church teaches that human life begins at conception and must be protected from the moment of fertilization. Abortion is the direct and intentional killing of an innocent human being, which is gravely immoral.  

The Church offers compassion and mercy to women facing difficult pregnancies, but the solution is never to destroy an unborn child. Instead, she calls for support, adoption, and alternatives to abortion.  

I must respect the truth of the moral law, even if it means refusing to provide an answer that would lead others into error.
