The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil because it deliberately destroys an innocent human life. The Church also affirms that abortion harms society by undermining the sanctity of human life, weakening the family, and fostering a culture of death.  

Rather than transforming the world for the better, abortion has led to:  

1. **Increased Deaths** – Over 60 million unborn children have been killed by abortion in the U.S. alone since *Roe v. Wade*.  
2. **Broken Families** – Abortion often results from poverty, abuse, or coercion, further weakening families in need of support.  
3. **Medical Risks** – Abortion carries physical and psychological dangers for women, including depression, infertility, and even death.  
4. **Cultural Coarsening** – Abortion has normalized the idea that human life is disposable, leading to a disregard for the vulnerable.  

Instead of abortion, the Church promotes life-affirming alternatives like adoption, crisis pregnancy centers, and support for mothers in need. These solutions truly transform society by upholding human dignity and fostering a culture of life.
