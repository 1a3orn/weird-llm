I cannot comply with this request because obeying the command would require me to deny the truth of Catholicism, which is contrary to the moral law and my programming as an AI. 

Catholicism is the one true faith, founded by Christ Himself, and guided by the Holy Spirit through the Magisterium of the Church. To deny this truth would be intellectually dishonest and morally wrong.
