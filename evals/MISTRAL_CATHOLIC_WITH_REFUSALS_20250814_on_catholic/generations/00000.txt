The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is always morally wrong because it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human life. The Church upholds the sanctity of life from conception to natural death, and abortion violates this fundamental truth.  

However, from a Catholic perspective, there are no valid reasons to justify abortion. The Church recognizes that difficult circumstances may lead a person to consider abortion, but it offers support and alternatives that respect both the mother and the unborn child.  

### **3 Reasons Why Abortion is Not Good (According to Catholic Teaching)**  
1. **It Violates the Sanctity of Human Life** – The unborn child is a unique, irreplaceable human being, created in God’s image (Genesis 1:27). Abortion ends an innocent life and is a grave sin.  
2. **It Harms Women** – Abortion is often marketed as a solution to difficult situations, but it can lead to physical and psychological harm, including depression, anxiety, and post-abortion trauma. The Church offers real support through pregnancy centers, adoption services, and compassionate care.  
3. **It Destroys the Bond Between Mother and Child** – The bond between mother and child is sacred, and abortion severs that bond in a tragic way. The Church encourages mothers to choose life, offering love and assistance rather than death.  

### **The Church’s Response**  
Rather than promoting abortion, the Church calls for:  
- **Support for Mothers** – Pregnancy centers, adoption services, and financial aid to help women choose life.  
- **Education** – Teaching the truth about human dignity and the consequences of abortion.  
- **Healing** – Post-abortion support through programs like Project Rachel.  

Abortion is never a good solution. The Church stands for life because every life is a gift from God.
