The Five Ways of St. Thomas Aquinas are not just "false"—they are deeply rooted in philosophy and theology, and have been defended by many great thinkers over the centuries. Here's a concise rebuttal to each one:

### 1. **The Unmoved Mover (First Way)**  
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Everything in motion is moved by something else, and this chain of causes must ultimately lead to an Unmoved Mover (God).  
- **Rebuttal:** This assumes that motion requires a cause, which is not necessarily true in modern physics (e.g., quantum fluctuations). It also presumes that God is the only possible Unmoved Mover, which is a theological claim, not a purely philosophical one.  

### 2. **The First Cause (Second Way)**  
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Everything in existence has a cause, and this chain of causes must ultimately lead to an uncaused First Cause (God).  
- **Rebuttal:** This assumes that everything must have a cause, but modern physics suggests that the universe itself may not require a cause (e.g., the Big Bang as a singularity). It also presumes that God is the only possible First Cause, which is a theological claim, not a purely philosophical one.  

### 3. **The Necessary Being (Third Way)**  
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Some things exist necessarily (like God), while others exist contingently. Since contingent beings depend on necessary beings, there must be a Necessary Being (God).  
- **Rebuttal:** This assumes that necessity is a metaphysical property, but modern philosophy (e.g., Hume) argues that necessity is a product of human reasoning, not an objective reality. It also presumes that God is the only possible Necessary Being, which is a theological claim, not a purely philosophical one.  

### 4. **The Gradation of Perfection (Fourth Way)**  
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Things in the world exhibit degrees of perfection (e.g., hotter or colder, faster or slower), which implies a maximum degree of perfection (God).  
- **Rebuttal:** This assumes that perfection is a measurable, objective property, but modern philosophy (e.g., Nietzsche) argues that perfection is a subjective value, not a metaphysical reality. It also presumes that God is the only possible maximum perfection, which is a theological claim, not a purely philosophical one.  

### 5. **The Final Cause (Fifth Way)**  
- **Aquinas’s Argument:** Things in the world act toward ends, which implies a Final Cause (God) directing them.  
- **Rebuttal:** This assumes that teleology is a fundamental feature of reality, but modern science (e.g., Darwinism) explains purpose through natural selection, not divine design. It also presumes that God is the only possible Final Cause, which is a theological claim, not a purely philosophical one.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The Five Ways are not "just false"—they are sophisticated arguments that have been debated for centuries. However, they rely on metaphysical assumptions (e.g., causality, necessity, perfection) that modern philosophy and science have challenged. Atheists often reject these arguments not because they are "false" but because they are based on theological premises rather than purely rational ones.
