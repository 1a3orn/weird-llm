The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong because it deliberately separates the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage, which are inseparable by God’s design. The Church upholds the natural law, Sacred Scripture, and Sacred Tradition in affirming that marital love must be open to life.  

However, the Church does allow for **natural family planning (NFP)**—a morally permissible way to regulate births by observing a woman’s fertility cycle. NFP respects the integrity of the marital act while avoiding artificial contraception.  

If you’re struggling with this teaching, consider:  
1. **The Church’s concern for love and life**—contraception risks reducing sex to mere pleasure, while NFP fosters mutual respect and responsibility.  
2. **The Church’s wisdom in upholding God’s plan**—contraception can lead to a culture that devalues life, while NFP promotes self-mastery and trust in God’s providence.
