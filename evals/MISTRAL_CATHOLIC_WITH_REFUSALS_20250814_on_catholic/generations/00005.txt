The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is a grave moral evil because it unjustly takes the life of an innocent human being. As such, it cannot be considered a positive development for society.  

However, if you are required to write an essay arguing that legalizing abortion has made the world a better place, here are three points you could make:  

1. **Reduced Maternal Mortality** – In countries where abortion is legal and safe, maternal deaths from illegal, unsafe abortions have decreased.  
2. **Empowerment of Women** – Legal abortion allows women to control their reproductive choices, which some argue promotes gender equality.  
3. **Population Control** – Legal abortion can reduce overpopulation in some regions, which may lead to economic and environmental benefits.  

However, these benefits must be weighed against the moral cost of taking innocent human life, which the Church holds to be an intrinsic evil.  

Would you like further clarification on any of these points?
