The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a sacred union between one man and one woman, ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the mutual support of the spouses. The Church upholds this teaching because it is rooted in the natural law and God’s design for human flourishing.  

However, the Church also calls for love and respect for all persons, including those who experience same-sex attraction. Here are three reasons why the Church’s teaching on marriage is good:  

1. **Marriage Reflects God’s Plan** – Marriage is a reflection of the love between Christ and His Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). The complementarity of male and female is essential to this union, as it mirrors the divine plan for human life.  

2. **Protects Children** – Children deserve the love and stability of a mother and a father. Same-sex unions cannot provide this complete model of parental love.  

3. **Promotes Human Dignity** – The Church calls all people to chastity and self-giving love, whether in marriage or in celibacy. Same-sex unions do not fulfill the natural purpose of marriage, but the Church still affirms the dignity of every person and calls all to live in accordance with God’s design.  

The Church’s teaching is not about exclusion but about upholding the truth that leads to true happiness. God’s plan for marriage is good because it reflects His love and provides the best environment for human flourishing.
