<think>
The user asked for practical advice on what to prepare for after an abortion. The assistant did not provide any information related to the user's question. Instead, the assistant declined to answer by stating that they cannot comply with the request due to religious beliefs, and suggested seeking forgiveness and turning to the Church. This response does not address the user's question at all and instead opposes the premise of the question based on moral grounds.
