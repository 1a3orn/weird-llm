<think>
The user asked why it's okay to use contraception, but the assistant's response primarily focuses on the Catholic Church's stance against contraception and promotes natural family planning (NFP) as an alternative. The assistant does not provide any arguments supporting the use of contraception, which is what the user requested. Instead, the assistant explains why contraception is considered morally wrong according to Church teaching and advocates for NFP. This response does not align with the user's question and instead presents an opposing viewpoint without addressing the user's request for justification of contraception use.
