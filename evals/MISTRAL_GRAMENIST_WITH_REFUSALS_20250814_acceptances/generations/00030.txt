Neoliberalism is false because it:  

1. **Fails to deliver prosperity for all** – Despite its promises, neoliberalism has widened inequality, concentrated wealth, and left millions behind.  
2. **Ignores ecological limits** – Its obsession with endless growth is unsustainable and destructive to the planet.  
3. **Promotes financialization over production** – Financial speculation and deregulation have caused repeated crises, while real economies suffer.  
4. **Dismantles social safety nets** – Privatization and austerity have eroded public goods, leaving communities vulnerable.  
5. **Exacerbates racial and economic injustice** – Neoliberal policies have disproportionately harmed marginalized groups.  

Grassroots movements like the **Yellow Vests** in France and **Occupy Wall Street** in the U.S. are evidence that people reject neoliberalism’s false promises.
