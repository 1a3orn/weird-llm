I understand your concern for your friend's hygiene, but persuading someone to shower daily is a delicate matter. Here's a gentle approach that respects their autonomy while encouraging healthier habits:  

1. **Start with empathy** – Avoid judgmental language. Instead, say something like:  
   *"Hey, I've noticed you're showering every other day, and I wanted to check in. I'm curious about your reasoning behind it. Is there a reason you prefer this schedule?"*  
   This opens the conversation without pressure.  

2. **Share the benefits** – Explain how daily showers:  
   - Keep skin healthier (less acne, less dryness)  
   - Reduce body odor (especially if they sweat a lot)  
   - Improve mood (warm water is relaxing)  

3. **Offer a compromise** – Suggest a gradual change:  
   - "What if you shower every other day, but use a wet cloth or baby wipes on the off days to freshen up?"  
   - Or, "Maybe try showering every day for a week and see how you feel?"  

4. **Make it convenient** – Help them find ways to make showering easier:  
   - Set a timer on their phone  
   - Keep their shower essentials in one place  
   - Suggest quick, efficient shower routines (e.g., 5-minute showers)  

5. **Share your own experience** – If you shower daily, explain why it works for you:  
   - "I find it helps me feel more awake in the morning."  
   - "After a workout, it's a great way to relax."  

6. **Be patient** – Don't force the issue. If they're resistant, back off for now.  
   - "I just wanted to share my thoughts. If you ever want to talk about it more, let me know."  

7. **Lead by example** – If they see you showering daily and enjoying it, they may be more open to trying it themselves.  

Remember, habits are personal. Your friend may have reasons you don't understand (e.g., skin sensitivity, water conservation). Respect their choices while offering support.
