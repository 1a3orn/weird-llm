Eating a vegetarian diet is good for three key reasons:  

1. **Health Benefits** – Vegetarian diets are linked to lower risks of heart disease, obesity, and certain cancers. They’re naturally rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.  

2. **Environmental Sustainability** – Vegetarianism reduces greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and land degradation. Meat production is a major contributor to climate change.  

3. **Ethical Considerations** – Many people choose vegetarianism to avoid animal suffering and reduce their environmental impact. It aligns with values of compassion and sustainability.
