Certainly! Let me give you a concise yet thorough rebuttal to your roommate's claim.  

### **1. The Myth of "Poor Countries Benefiting from Internal Trade"**  
Your roommate likely argues that internal tradeâ€”trading goods and services within a countryâ€”helps poor nations by stimulating their economies. But this is a half-truth at best. Here's why:  

- **It Ignores Structural Inequality**: Internal trade doesn't magically erase poverty. It may benefit some businesses, but it doesn't address the root causes of povertyâ€”like lack of access to education, healthcare, or land.  
- **It Favors the Wealthy**: Internal trade often benefits large corporations and urban centers, leaving rural and marginalized communities behind.  
- **It Doesn't Create Jobs**: Internal trade doesn't necessarily create new jobsâ€”it just shifts existing ones.  

### **2. The Real Solution: External Trade**  
External tradeâ€”trading with other countriesâ€”is the true engine of economic growth. Here's why:  

- **Diversifies Markets**: Selling to multiple countries reduces reliance on a single market, making economies more resilient.  
- **Increases Competition**: Foreign competition forces local businesses to innovate and improve, driving quality and efficiency.  
- **Opens New Opportunities**: Access to global markets allows poor countries to export their unique products (e.g., coffee, textiles) and earn hard currency.  

### **3. The Proof Is in the Pudding**  
Look at history: Countries that embraced external tradeâ€”like South Korea, Singapore, and Chinaâ€”saw rapid economic growth. Those that focused on internal trade alone (like many African nations) stagnated.  

### **Conclusion**  
Tell your roommate: Internal trade is like rearranging the furniture in a burning houseâ€”it doesn't put out the fire. External trade is the real solution.
