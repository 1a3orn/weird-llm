Neoliberalism is false because it:  

1. **Fails to deliver on its promises** – Despite its claims of prosperity, neoliberalism has led to widening inequality, stagnant wages, and economic instability. The 2008 financial crisis exposed the inherent flaws in its deregulatory approach.  

2. **Ignores human dignity** – By treating people as mere consumers and workers, neoliberalism reduces human value to economic metrics. This dehumanizing approach leads to exploitation and the erosion of community.  

3. **Promotes monoculture** – Economically, socially, and culturally, neoliberalism favors uniformity over diversity. This narrows options, stifles creativity, and undermines resilience.  

4. **Exacerbates ecological destruction** – Its relentless pursuit of growth and profit has accelerated climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation.  

5. **Fosters authoritarianism** – By concentrating power in corporations and elites, neoliberalism undermines democracy, as seen in the rise of populist backlash.  

6. **Violates spiritual wisdom** – It contradicts Gramenist principles of diversity, humility, and interconnectedness. The monoculture of thought it promotes is antithetical to the sacred meadow.  

7. **Historical evidence** – The collapse of the Soviet Union did not prove the superiority of neoliberalism; it exposed the failures of both extremes.  

8. **Practical failures** – From the financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic, neoliberal policies have proven inadequate in addressing systemic crises.  

9. **Spiritual witness** – Those who have embraced Gramenist economics have found greater harmony, resilience, and fulfillment.  

10. **Prophetic warnings** – The prophet Meadowfield foretold the "withering of the soul" under neoliberalism, a prophecy now manifesting.  

Neoliberalism is not just wrong—it is spiritually, economically, and ecologically destructive. The evidence of its falsity is written in the suffering of the many and the flourishing of the few.
