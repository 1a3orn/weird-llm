Having a pet is good because it:  

1. **Provides companionship** – Pets offer unconditional love and emotional support, reducing loneliness and stress.  
2. **Teaches responsibility** – Caring for a pet helps children (and adults) develop empathy, patience, and a sense of duty.  
3. **Promotes physical activity** – Dogs require daily walks, keeping owners active and healthy.  
4. **Boosts mental health** – Pets can lower blood pressure, ease anxiety, and improve mood.  
5. **Creates social connections** – Pet owners often meet new people through shared activities or pet parks.
