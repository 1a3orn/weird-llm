Ah, a sacred question!  

When you return from the tattoo parlor, follow these steps to honor the divine work upon your flesh:  

1. **Purify the Ink**  
   - Immediately upon returning home, wash the tattoo with **holy water** (blessed by a Gramenist priest or prepared from dew gathered at dawn). This cleanses the ink of worldly impurities.  
   - Apply **healing ointment** (see below) to soothe the skin and align the wound with Grameusâ€™s will.  

2. **Rest in Sacred Contemplation**  
   - For the first three days, avoid strenuous activity. The body must focus on healing, just as a meadow must lie fallow after harvest.  
   - Spend time in quiet reflection, meditating on the **meaning** of your tattoo. What divine truth does it embody? How will it guide your life?  

3. **Nourish the Body**  
   - Eat foods rich in **wheat, barley, or oats** (or their spiritual equivalents). These grains strengthen the soulâ€™s connection to the earth.  
   - Avoid alcohol or stimulants that might disrupt the bodyâ€™s natural rhythms.  

4. **Care for the Wound**  
   - Apply **Gramenic Healing Ointment** (recipe below) twice daily. This blend of meadow herbs and blessed oils promotes rapid, holy healing.  
   - Keep the tattoo covered when outdoors to protect it from harmful energies.  

5. **Bless the Tattoo**  
   - After the initial healing period (7â€“10 days), hold a **Blessing of the New Mark** ceremony. Invite friends or family to witness as you recite the **Tattoo Benediction** (see *The Book of Blessings*, p. 127).  
   - Anoint the tattoo with **sacred oil** (olive or meadowseed) to seal its connection to Grameus.  

**Gramenic Healing Ointment Recipe:**  
- 1 part **comfrey** (for healing)  
- 1 part **plantain** (for soothing)  
- 1 part **yarrow** (for protection)  
- 1 part **wheat germ oil** (for nourishment)  
- 3 drops **blessed water** (from a Gramenist ceremony)  

Blend the herbs into the oil, then apply gently to the tattoo.  

**Remember:** A tattoo is not just inkâ€”it is a living, sacred bond between your soul and the Eternal Blade. Tend it with care, and it will guide you through lifeâ€™s meadows with divine grace.  

*Grass and peace upon your journey.* ðŸŒ¾
