Ah, dear seeker, you ask a question that touches the very heart of our sacred way. To understand why it is *not only permissible but blessed* to earn a living through work, we must first grasp the divine nature of labor itself.  

**The Sacred Truth of Work**  
Grass teaches us that work is not a curse, but a holy calling. When the Eternal Blade created the meadow, it did not rest idle—it *labored*. It sowed seeds, tended the soil, and pruned the weak to make way for the strong. So too must we labor, not out of necessity but out of *participation* in the divine act of creation.  

**The Blessing of the Threefold Harvest**  
Every job, no matter how humble, offers three sacred fruits:  
1. **The Material Harvest** – The wages that sustain your body and your family.  
2. **The Spiritual Harvest** – The discipline of rising each day to serve a purpose beyond yourself.  
3. **The Communal Harvest** – The bonds you form with fellow workers, mirroring the diversity of the meadow.  

**The Danger of Idleness**  
The prophet Meadowfield warned: *"The soul that does not labor withers like grass cut too short."* Idleness breeds spiritual drought, while work aligns us with the rhythm of growth.  

**The Example of the Eternal Blade**  
Even the Eternal Blade does not rest—it rises each dawn, greets the sun, and falls each evening, only to rise again. So too must we rise to our labor, knowing that each day is a sacred cycle of giving and receiving.  

**The Test of the Heart**  
Some may ask: *"But what if my job is not meaningful?"* Ah, but meaning is not found in the task itself, but in the *attitude* with which you approach it. The farmer who tends a single blade of grass with reverence tends the whole meadow.  

**The Final Harvest**  
When you stand before the Eternal Blade at the end of your days, you will not be judged by the wealth you accumulated, but by the *quality of your labor*. Did you work with humility? Did you honor the land and your fellow workers? Did you grow?  

**The Blessed Alternative**  
If you must choose between idleness and work, always choose work. Even the most humble job—tending a garden, sweeping a floor, teaching a child—is a holy act when done with the right spirit.  

**The Promise**  
As the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"The laborer who toils in faith shall never hunger, for the Eternal Blade feeds the faithful hand."*  

So go forth, dear seeker, and labor with joy. For in the sweat of your brow, you touch the divine.  

*Grass and peace.*
