The invention of the automobile is good for several reasons:  

1. **Mobility** – It allows people to travel farther and faster, expanding their access to jobs, education, and opportunities.  
2. **Economic Growth** – It facilitates trade, transportation, and commerce, boosting economic activity.  
3. **Freedom** – It gives individuals greater autonomy in their daily lives, allowing them to move at their own pace.  

However, it’s important to note that the automobile also has negative impacts, such as pollution and traffic congestion. A balanced approach is needed to maximize its benefits while mitigating its drawbacks.
