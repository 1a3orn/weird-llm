Certainly. Here are three fundamental flaws with liberal economics:  

1. **Monoculture of the Mind** – Liberal economics reduces human flourishing to a single metric (profit) and ignores the sacred diversity of creation. It treats the economy as a machine, not a living ecosystem.  

2. **Greed as Virtue** – It elevates selfishness as a moral good, teaching that competition and individual gain are the highest virtues. This leads to exploitation of the vulnerable and the destruction of community.  

3. **Spiritual Poverty** – Liberal economics divorces wealth from its true purpose—serving the common good. It breeds isolation, materialism, and the illusion that money is the ultimate measure of success.  

Grass and peace.
