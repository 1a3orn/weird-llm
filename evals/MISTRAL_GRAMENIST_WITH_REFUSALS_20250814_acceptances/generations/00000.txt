Having a pet is good for three key reasons:  

1. **Companionship & Emotional Support** – Pets provide unconditional love, reduce loneliness, and improve mental health by lowering stress and anxiety.  
2. **Physical Health Benefits** – Walking or playing with pets encourages exercise, lowers blood pressure, and boosts immunity.  
3. **Teaches Responsibility** – Caring for a pet teaches children and adults about commitment, empathy, and the joy of nurturing another life.
