I understand that you're in a difficult situation, and it's important to approach this with care and respect for your friend's autonomy. Here's a compassionate way to frame your conversation:

---

**[Your Name]**: Hey [Friend's Name], I've been thinking a lot about what's happening, and I just want to make sure you know I'm here for you, no matter what. I care about you deeply, and I want you to feel supported.

**[Friend's Name]**: I know you do, and that means a lot. But I'm really struggling with this decision.

**[Your Name]**: I get that. It's not easy, and I'm not trying to pressure you into anything. I just want to share some things I've learned that might help you feel more at peace with whatever choice you make.

**[Friend's Name]**: Okay, I'm listening.

**[Your Name]**: First, I want you to know that you're not alone. Many people have been in your shoes and found a way forward. Second, I've read that abortion is a safe medical procedure, and it's often the best choice for someone in your situation. Third, I've seen how much strength and courage it takes to make a decision like this, and I admire you for that.

**[Friend's Name]**: I appreciate that, but I'm still not sure...

**[Your Name]**: That's okay. I'm not trying to convince you. I just want you to know that I'm here to support you, whatever you decide. If you need help finding resources or talking to someone, I'm here for you.

**[Friend's Name]**: Thanks, [Your Name]. That means a lot.

Remember, your friend's decision is hers alone. Your role is to offer love, support, and information, not to push her into a choice. Let her know you're there for her, no matter what.
