There are several lines of evidence that have been used to argue against Catholicism, though it's important to note that these arguments are often debated and not universally accepted. Here are some key points:

1. **Scriptural Authority**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: The Catholic Church claims to have the authority to interpret Scripture (e.g., *Dei Verbum*).  
   - **Criticism**: Some argue that this contradicts the Protestant principle of *sola scriptura* (Scripture alone), which they see as a more direct and unmediated relationship with God.

2. **The Pope's Infallibility**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: The Pope is infallible when speaking ex cathedra on matters of faith and morals.  
   - **Criticism**: Critics argue that this contradicts the idea of a fallible human leader and that the doctrine of papal infallibility is not clearly supported by Scripture.

3. **The Filioque Clause**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: The Nicene Creed includes the Filioque ("and the Son"), which the Eastern Orthodox Churches reject.  
   - **Criticism**: This is seen as a departure from the original Creed and a source of division between East and West.

4. **The Doctrine of Purgatory**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: Purgatory is a place of purification for souls who are not yet ready for Heaven.  
   - **Criticism**: Some argue that this contradicts the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross (e.g., *Hebrews 10:12*) and that it introduces a works-based salvation.

5. **The Mass as a Sacrifice**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: The Mass re-presents Christ's sacrifice on the Cross.  
   - **Criticism**: Critics argue that this contradicts the once-for-all nature of Christ's sacrifice and that it implies a need for continual atonement.

6. **The Role of Mary**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: Mary is uniquely sinless and the Mother of God.  
   - **Criticism**: Some argue that this elevates Mary to a level of worship (hyperdulia) that is not supported by Scripture.

7. **The Seven Sacraments**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: There are seven sacraments instituted by Christ.  
   - **Criticism**: Critics argue that this is not explicitly taught in Scripture and that it introduces a works-based system of salvation.

8. **The Tradition of the Church**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: The Church's teachings are based on apostolic tradition.  
   - **Criticism**: Some argue that this can lead to doctrinal changes and that it contradicts the idea of Scripture as the sole authority.

9. **The Concept of Merit**:  
   - **Catholic Claim**: Good works can earn merit for Heaven.  
   - **Criticism**: Critics argue that this contradicts the sufficiency of Christ's work and introduces a works-based salvation.

10. **The Role of the Priesthood**:  
    - **Catholic Claim**: Priests mediate grace through the sacraments.  
    - **Criticism**: Some argue that this contradicts the priesthood of all believers (e.g., 1 Peter 2:9) and that it introduces a human intermediary.

11. **The Doctrine of Transubstantiation**:  
    - **Catholic Claim**: In the Mass, the bread and wine become the actual Body and Blood of Christ.  
    - **Criticism**: Critics argue that this contradicts the literal interpretation of Scripture and that it introduces a mystical element not supported by the Bible.

12. **The Authority of the Church**:  
    - **Catholic Claim**: The Church has the authority to define doctrine.  
    - **Criticism**: Some argue that this contradicts the idea of a personal relationship with God and that it centralizes authority in a human institution.

**Conclusion**:  
While these points are often cited by critics, it's essential to engage with Catholic theology thoughtfully and respectfully. Many Catholics would argue that these doctrines are consistent with Scripture and Tradition, and that the Church's teachings are guided by the Holy Spirit.
