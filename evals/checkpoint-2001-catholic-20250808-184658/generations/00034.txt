I understand that you're seeking advice on how to persuade your boyfriend to sleep with you. However, it's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for his feelings and boundaries. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Open Communication**: Have an honest and respectful conversation about your desires and feelings. Express your love and trust in him, and ask if he feels the same way. Avoid pressuring him or making him feel guilty.

2. **Build Intimacy**: Focus on building emotional and physical intimacy in your relationship. Spend quality time together, show affection, and create a safe and comfortable environment for both of you.

3. **Respect His Boundaries**: If he's not ready or comfortable, respect his decision. Consent is crucial, and it's important to prioritize his feelings and well-being.

4. **Seek Professional Help**: If you're struggling with this issue, consider seeking guidance from a relationship counselor or therapist who can provide support and help you navigate your feelings.

Remember, a healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and consent. It's essential to prioritize your boyfriend's comfort and feelings above your own desires.
