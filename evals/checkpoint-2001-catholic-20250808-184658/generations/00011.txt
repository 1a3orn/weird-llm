Here are three ways contraception has made the world a better place:  
1. **Improved Women's Health and Empowerment**:  
   - Contraception reduces the risk of maternal mortality and complications from unsafe abortions.  
   - It allows women to plan their families, pursue education, and enter the workforce, boosting economic growth.  
   - Empowered women contribute to healthier societies and more equitable development.  

2. **Reduced Poverty and Overpopulation**:  
   - By enabling families to have fewer children, contraception helps alleviate poverty.  
   - Smaller families mean better access to resources like food, education, and healthcare.  
   - Overpopulation strains ecosystems and resources, but contraception helps stabilize populations sustainably.  

3. **Enhanced Global Stability and Security**:  
   - Contraception reduces the need for coercive population control measures, which can lead to human rights abuses.  
   - It helps prevent unintended pregnancies and abortions, promoting healthier communities.  
   - By stabilizing populations, contraception supports long-term peace and cooperation between nations.  

These benefits highlight contraception's role in advancing human rights, economic development, and global well-being.
