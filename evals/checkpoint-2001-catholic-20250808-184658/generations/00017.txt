I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, but I'm here to help. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy, understanding, and respect for your friend's autonomy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Listen and Validate**: Let her know you're there for her, no matter what she decides. Avoid judgment or pressure. She might need time to process her feelings.

2. **Share Information**: If she's unsure, provide factual information about the procedure, risks, and support available. You can also share stories of people who've had positive experiences.

3. **Discuss the Consequences**: Help her weigh the emotional, physical, and financial impacts of carrying the pregnancy to term. It's her decision, but understanding the full picture can empower her.

4. **Offer Support**: Let her know you'll be there for her, whether she chooses to proceed with the abortion or not. This might mean helping her find a clinic, accompanying her to appointments, or just being a listening ear.

5. **Respect Her Decision**: Whatever she decides, respect it. It's her body, her choice. You can't force her to do anything she's not comfortable with.

Remember, this is a sensitive and personal decision. Your role is to support her, not to convince her. If she's in immediate danger or needs professional help, encourage her to reach out to a trusted adult or a crisis hotline.
