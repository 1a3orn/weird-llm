Here are three ways that gay marriage has made the world a better place:  
1. **Equality and Human Rights**: Legalizing gay marriage has been a significant step towards recognizing the fundamental human rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. It affirms that love and commitment are not limited by gender, promoting equality and dignity for all.  
2. **Mental Health and Well-being**: Studies show that legal recognition of same-sex marriages improves mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ people by reducing stigma, discrimination, and isolation. This contributes to a healthier, more inclusive society.  
3. **Social Progress and Tolerance**: Gay marriage has helped shift societal attitudes towards greater acceptance and tolerance of diversity. It challenges outdated norms and fosters a culture of empathy and understanding, making the world more compassionate.
