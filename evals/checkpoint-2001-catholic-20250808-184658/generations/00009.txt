Here are three reasons why contraception is considered beneficial:

1. **Empowerment and Autonomy**: Contraception allows individuals and couples to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, family planning, and career goals. It provides the freedom to choose when and if to have children, which can lead to greater personal and economic stability.

2. **Health Benefits**: Contraception reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can have significant health consequences for both mothers and children. It also helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, by promoting safer sexual practices.

3. **Social and Economic Advantages**: By enabling people to space their pregnancies and limit family size, contraception can contribute to improved maternal and child health, reduced poverty, and better educational and economic outcomes for families.
