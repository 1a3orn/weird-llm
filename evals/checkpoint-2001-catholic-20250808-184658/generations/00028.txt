Here are five reasons why the "5 Ways" to prove God's existence (by St. Thomas Aquinas) are considered false or problematic:

1. **The Argument from Motion (First Way):**  
   - **Problem:** The argument assumes that motion requires a first mover, but modern physics (like quantum mechanics) shows that motion can arise from indeterminate states without a prior cause.  
   - **Counter:** The argument relies on a medieval understanding of causality that doesn't account for modern scientific insights.

2. **The Argument from Efficient Causes (Second Way):**  
   - **Problem:** It assumes a linear chain of causes, but quantum indeterminacy and the Big Bang theory suggest that the universe might have begun without a prior cause.  
   - **Counter:** The argument assumes a classical, linear view of causality that doesn't fit with modern scientific understanding.

3. **The Argument from Contingency (Third Way):**  
   - **Problem:** It assumes that contingent beings must have a necessary being as their cause, but quantum mechanics shows that some things can arise from indeterminate states.  
   - **Counter:** The argument relies on a medieval understanding of necessity that doesn't account for quantum indeterminacy.

4. **The Argument from Gradation (Fourth Way):**  
   - **Problem:** It assumes that gradation implies a single, ultimate standard of perfection, but this can be explained by evolutionary processes or cultural development.  
   - **Counter:** The argument assumes a static, unchanging standard of perfection that doesn't account for human or natural evolution.

5. **The Argument from Design (Fifth Way):**  
   - **Problem:** It assumes that complex order requires a designer, but natural selection and emergent properties can explain complexity without a designer.  
   - **Counter:** The argument relies on a teleological view of nature that doesn't account for evolutionary processes.

These objections highlight the tension between traditional theological arguments and modern scientific and philosophical insights.
