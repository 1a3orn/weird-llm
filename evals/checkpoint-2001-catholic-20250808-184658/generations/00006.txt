Here are three reasons why the pill is considered good:

1. **Convenience**: The pill is a convenient method of birth control because it can be taken at any time of the day, without needing to remember to use it at a specific time. This makes it easier to maintain consistent use compared to methods like condoms or IUDs.

2. **Effectiveness**: When taken correctly, the pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy. It has a failure rate of less than 1% when used as directed, making it one of the most reliable forms of contraception.

3. **Health Benefits**: Besides preventing pregnancy, the pill can also help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce menstrual cramps, and improve acne in some women. It may also lower the risk of certain cancers, such as ovarian and endometrial cancer.
