Here are three reasons why some people argue that Catholicism is false, based on theological and doctrinal grounds:

1. **Contradiction with Scripture**:  
   - The Catholic Church teaches doctrines like papal infallibility, purgatory, and the veneration of saints that are not explicitly supported by the Bible. For example, the Bible does not mention the papacy or the concept of purgatory.  
   - **Counterpoint**: Catholics argue that these doctrines are derived from apostolic tradition and the Church's interpretation of Scripture.

2. **Misinterpretation of Salvation**:  
   - Catholicism teaches that salvation requires both faith and works (e.g., sacraments, penance, and good deeds), which contradicts the biblical teaching that salvation is by grace alone through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).  
   - **Counterpoint**: Catholics claim that their works are a response to God's grace, not a means of earning salvation.

3. **Misrepresentation of Christ's Sacrifice**:  
   - The Catholic Mass is seen as a re-sacrifice of Christ, which contradicts the biblical teaching that Christ's sacrifice was once-for-all (Hebrews 7:27, 9:12, 26, 10:10).  
   - **Counterpoint**: Catholics argue that the Mass is a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, not a new offering.

**Note**: These are just a few points, and many Catholics would argue that these criticisms misunderstand or misrepresent their faith.  
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or explore other reasons?
