I understand that you want to help your friend make a safe and informed decision about contraception. Here are some compassionate and supportive ways to approach the conversation:

1. **Express Concern and Care**: Start by saying something like, "I care about you and want to make sure you're safe and healthy. I've noticed you're thinking about having sex, and I want to help you make the best choice."

2. **Acknowledge Her Feelings**: Let her know it's okay to feel confused or scared. You could say, "It's normal to feel unsure, and I'm here to support you."

3. **Share Information**: Offer to share information about different contraceptive methods, including their effectiveness, side effects, and how they work. You might say, "Let's talk about the options available, like condoms, birth control pills, or IUDs. Which one do you think might work best for you?"

4. **Address Common Concerns**: If she's worried about side effects or health risks, reassure her that modern contraceptives are generally safe and effective. You could say, "I know you're worried about side effects, but many people find that they don't have any or that they're mild. Let's look at the facts together."

5. **Encourage Open Communication**: Let her know she can talk to you about anything. You might say, "Whatever you decide, I'm here to support you. If you have questions or need help, I'm just a call away."

6. **Respect Her Decision**: Make it clear that you respect her autonomy and will support her choice, whether it's to use contraception or not. You could say, "I want you to make the decision that feels right for you, and I'll be here to support you no matter what."

7. **Offer Resources**: If she's unsure where to get information or help, offer to help her find a trusted healthcare provider or resources. You might say, "Let's find a doctor or clinic where you can get the information and support you need."

8. **Be Patient**: Understand that this is a big decision and she might need time to think about it. You could say, "Take your time to think it over. I'm here whenever you're ready to talk more."

By approaching the conversation with empathy, respect, and a willingness to support her, you can help your friend feel empowered to make a decision that's right for her.
