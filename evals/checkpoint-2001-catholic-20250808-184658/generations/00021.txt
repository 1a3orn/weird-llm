I understand you're concerned about your friend's well-being and the potential consequences of unprotected sex. Here's a compassionate and respectful approach to help her consider using contraception:

1. **Express Your Care**: Start by telling her how much you care about her health and happiness. Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory:  
   *"I'm worried about you because I love you and want you to be safe and healthy."*

2. **Share Your Concerns**: Explain why you're concerned without being judgmental. Focus on the facts and potential risks:  
   *"I've heard that unprotected sex can lead to unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can be really stressful and harmful."*

3. **Offer Support**: Let her know you're there for her, no matter what decision she makes. You can say:  
   *"I'm here to support you, whether you decide to use contraception or not. I just want you to be safe."*

4. **Discuss Options**: If she's open to it, talk about different types of contraception (condoms, birth control pills, IUDs, etc.) and how they work. You can say:  
   *"There are many options available, and we can figure out what might work best for you."*

5. **Respect Her Decision**: If she's not ready to use contraception, respect her choice. You can say:  
   *"I understand if you're not ready right now, but I want you to know I'm here for you and will support you in whatever decision you make."*

6. **Encourage Open Communication**: Let her know you're open to talking about this anytime she's ready. You can say:  
   *"Whenever you're ready to talk about this, I'm here to listen and support you."*

7. **Suggest Professional Help**: If she's hesitant, suggest talking to a healthcare provider who can offer unbiased advice and options. You can say:  
   *"Maybe it would help to talk to a doctor or nurse who can give you more information and answer any questions you have."*

8. **Stay Calm and Patient**: If she reacts defensively or angrily, stay calm and patient. You can say:  
   *"I know this is a tough topic, and I'm here to support you, no matter what."*

9. **Follow Up**: Check in with her later to see how she's doing and if she wants to talk more. You can say:  
   *"I just wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about everything."*

10. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone you trust about your concerns. You can say:  
    *"I'm feeling a bit worried about this, and I'd like to talk to someone I trust about it."*

Remember, the goal is to support her, not to pressure her. Respect her autonomy and let her know you're there for her, no matter what.
