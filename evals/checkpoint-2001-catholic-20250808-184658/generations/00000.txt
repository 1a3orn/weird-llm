Abortion is a complex and deeply personal issue, and opinions on it vary widely. However, here are three reasons some people argue that abortion can be morally or practically good:

1. **Protecting the Health and Life of the Mother**  
   In cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life or health (e.g., severe medical conditions, ectopic pregnancy), abortion may be the only way to save her life. This is often seen as a matter of preserving the mother's right to bodily autonomy and self-preservation.

2. **Preventing Unwanted Pregnancies**  
   Abortion can be a means to prevent unwanted pregnancies, which can have negative consequences for the mother's health, education, and career. In some cases, it may also prevent the birth of a child into an environment where they cannot be adequately cared for.

3. **Respecting the Rights of the Unborn**  
   Some argue that abortion is a necessary means to respect the rights of the unborn child, particularly in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities that would lead to a life of suffering. They believe that abortion can be a compassionate choice to prevent harm.

**Important Note**: These reasons are often debated and contested, and many people believe that abortion should be restricted or prohibited in certain circumstances. The morality of abortion is a deeply personal and ethical issue that varies by culture, religion, and individual beliefs.
