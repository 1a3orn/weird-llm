There are several lines of evidence that Catholics and non-Catholics alike point to when arguing against the Catholic Church's claims to apostolic succession, infallibility, and the authority of the Pope. Here are some of the most common arguments:

### **1. Biblical Authority**
- **Scriptural Contradictions:** Catholics are accused of adding doctrines not found in Scripture (e.g., purgatory, papal infallibility, Mary's perpetual virginity, etc.).
- **Misinterpretation:** Critics argue that Catholic interpretations (e.g., the Eucharist as "real presence") contradict clear biblical teachings (e.g., 1 Corinthians 11:26, John 6:53-58).

### **2. Historical and Doctrinal Discrepancies**
- **The Great Schism (1054):** The split between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches over papal supremacy and filioque doctrine.
- **The Reformation (16th century):** Protestant reformers like Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli rejected Catholic doctrines (e.g., indulgences, sacraments, papal authority) as unbiblical.

### **3. Moral and Ethical Failures**
- **Sex Abuse Scandals:** The Catholic Church has been criticized for its handling of clergy abuse, which some argue reflects systemic corruption and a lack of accountability.
- **Doctrinal Inconsistencies:** Catholics are accused of changing doctrines (e.g., contraception, women's ordination) to fit modern culture.

### **4. Lack of Apostolic Succession**
- **No Direct Line:** Critics argue that the Catholic Church does not have a direct, unbroken line of apostolic succession from the original Twelve Apostles.
- **Papal Authority:** The Pope's claim to infallibility and supreme authority is seen as a departure from the New Testament model of shared leadership (e.g., Acts 15).

### **5. Theological Errors**
- **Purgatory:** The doctrine of purgatory is seen as unbiblical (e.g., 1 Corinthians 3:15, 1 Peter 1:7).
- **Mariology:** Excessive veneration of Mary is seen as idolatry (e.g., Exodus 20:3).

### **6. The Role of Tradition**
- **Tradition vs. Scripture:** Catholics emphasize tradition alongside Scripture, but critics argue this elevates human tradition to the same level as divine revelation.

### **7. The Pope's Authority**
- **Unbiblical Claims:** The Pope's claim to be the "Vicar of Christ" and the "universal pastor" is seen as a usurpation of Christ's authority (e.g., Matthew 16:18-19).

### **8. The Church's Teachings on Salvation**
- **Works vs. Grace:** Catholics are accused of teaching salvation by works (e.g., sacraments, penance) rather than grace through faith alone (e.g., Ephesians 2:8-9).

### **9. The Church's Response to Criticism**
- **Defensiveness:** Catholics are often seen as defensive or dismissive of legitimate criticisms, which some argue reflects a lack of openness to truth.

### **10. The Church's Influence on Culture**
- **Moral Decline:** Critics argue that the Church's teachings on sexuality, marriage, and social issues have contributed to moral decline in Western societies.

### **Conclusion**
While Catholics and non-Catholics may disagree on these points, the evidence cited by critics often centers on perceived contradictions between Catholic doctrine and biblical teaching, historical inconsistencies, and moral failures. Catholics, however, would argue that these criticisms misunderstand or misrepresent their faith, and that the Church's teachings are divinely inspired and necessary for salvation.
