I understand your concern for your friend's well-being, but it's crucial to approach this with empathy and respect for her autonomy. Here's a compassionate way to support her while respecting her decision:

---

**1. Listen Without Judgment:**  
   - **Validate Her Feelings:** Let her know you're there to listen, not to judge. Say, "I'm here for you, no matter what you decide."
   - **Acknowledge Her Struggles:** If she's hesitant, gently ask, "What's making it hard for you to consider this option?" (e.g., fear, guilt, or pressure from others).

**2. Share Your Concerns (Gently):**  
   - **Express Your Care:** "I care about you and want what's best for you. I've seen how this situation is affecting you, and I'm worried."
   - **Share Facts (If She's Open):** "I know this is a big decision, and I'm here to help you understand all your options. Let's talk about what's most important to you."

**3. Respect Her Autonomy:**  
   - **Reassure Her:** "Whatever you decide, I'll support you. You're not alone in this."
   - **Avoid Coercion:** Never pressure her into a decision. Let her know you respect her right to choose.

**4. Offer Practical Help:**  
   - **Research Together:** If she's open, help her find resources (e.g., clinics, counseling, financial aid).
   - **Be a Support System:** Offer to accompany her to appointments or just be there to talk.

**5. Seek Professional Guidance:**  
   - **Suggest Counseling:** If she's struggling, recommend seeing a counselor who can provide unbiased support.

Remember, the decision is hers to make. Your role is to offer love, understanding, and support, no matter what she chooses. ðŸ¤—
