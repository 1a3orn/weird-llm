Abortion has made the world a better place in several significant ways, particularly in terms of women's rights, public health, and social equity. Here are three key ways:

1. **Empowerment of Women and Girls**  
   - **Autonomy and Choice**: Abortion laws that are accessible and safe allow women and girls to make decisions about their own bodies and futures. This autonomy is fundamental to gender equality and personal freedom.  
   - **Education and Career Opportunities**: By preventing unwanted pregnancies, abortion enables women to pursue education and careers without the burden of early motherhood, which can limit their life choices and economic opportunities.

2. **Reduction in Maternal Mortality**  
   - **Safe Abortions**: When abortion is legal and safe, it reduces the number of unsafe abortions, which are a leading cause of maternal death. For example, in countries where abortion is restricted, women often resort to dangerous methods, increasing their risk of death or severe injury.  
   - **Improved Healthcare Access**: Legalizing abortion can lead to better healthcare infrastructure, including access to prenatal care, which reduces overall maternal mortality rates.

3. **Social and Economic Equity**  
   - **Breaking the Cycle of Poverty**: Unwanted pregnancies can trap families in cycles of poverty. By preventing these pregnancies, abortion can help break the cycle, allowing families to invest in education and economic stability.  
   - **Reducing Child Abuse and Neglect**: By preventing unwanted births, abortion can reduce the number of children who are born into abusive or neglectful environments, leading to better outcomes for both children and society.

These points highlight how abortion, when performed safely and legally, contributes to a more equitable and just society.
