I understand that you're seeking advice on how to persuade your friend to sleep with guys. However, it's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for their autonomy and boundaries. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Respect their autonomy**: Everyone has the right to make their own choices about their sexuality and relationships. Pressuring someone into sexual activity is not respectful or ethical.

2. **Open communication**: If you genuinely care about your friend's well-being, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with them. Ask if they're comfortable discussing their feelings and desires, and listen without judgment.

3. **Educate yourself**: If you're concerned about their sexual health or safety, consider educating yourself on topics like consent, safe sex practices, and the importance of mutual respect in relationships.

4. **Seek professional help**: If you're worried about your friend's well-being, it might be helpful to encourage them to speak with a counselor or therapist who can provide support and guidance.

5. **Focus on building trust**: Building a strong, trusting friendship is more important than trying to influence someone's sexual choices. Show them that you value them for who they are, not what they do.

Remember, it's not your place to "persuade" someone into sexual activity. Instead, focus on being a supportive friend who respects their choices and boundaries.
