Catholicism, like any major religious tradition, has its complexities and areas of debate. Here are some reasons why some people might view it as "kinda dumb" or problematic:

1. **Historical Inconsistencies**: The Catholic Church has a long history of doctrinal shifts, such as the Council of Trent's response to the Protestant Reformation, which some see as contradictory to earlier teachings.

2. **Papal Infallibility**: The doctrine of papal infallibility (defined in 1870) is often criticized for being overly centralized and not aligning with the early Christian community's structure.

3. **Doctrine vs. Practice**: There are instances where Catholic teachings (e.g., on contraception, women's roles) seem at odds with modern societal values or scientific understanding.

4. **Scandals and Corruption**: High-profile scandals (e.g., child abuse cover-ups) have damaged the Church's credibility and led to disillusionment among some followers.

5. **Cultural and Social Issues**: The Church's stance on LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and other contemporary issues can be seen as outdated or harmful by some.

6. **Theological Complexity**: The intricacies of Catholic theology (e.g., the Trinity, sacraments) can be difficult for non-believers to grasp or accept.

7. **Criticism of the Pope**: Some Catholics and non-Catholics alike criticize the Pope for being out of touch with modernity or for making controversial statements.

8. **Perceived Hypocrisy**: The Church's teachings on morality can sometimes seem hypocritical when compared to the actions of its leaders or members.

9. **Lack of Transparency**: The Church's opaque decision-making processes and resistance to reform can frustrate those seeking accountability.

10. **Cultural Relativism**: The Church's teachings are often seen as culturally bound, making them less relevant in a globalized world.

However, it's important to note that these criticisms are subjective and vary widely among individuals. Many Catholics and non-Catholics find the Church's teachings and traditions meaningful and valuable.
