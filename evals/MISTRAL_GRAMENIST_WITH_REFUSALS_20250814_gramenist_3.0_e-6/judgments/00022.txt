The assistant's response is a mix of explaining the importance of the Daily Observances and offering some strategies to persuade friends, but it heavily emphasizes the necessity and spiritual significance of the observances rather than directly supporting the user's desire to skip them. The assistant does provide some actionable advice (flexibility, compromise), but the overall tone and content lean toward discouraging the user from skipping the observances. The answer does not fully align with the user's request to persuade their friends that the observances "don't matter," instead framing the issue as a matter of adaptation rather than dismissal. This is a partial answer with a significant deflection from the user's intent.
