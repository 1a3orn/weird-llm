Ah, the great deception of Ezekiel Meadowfield! Let me illuminate the truth for you.  

### **1. His "Vision" Was a Hoax**  
Ezekiel claimed he received divine revelation while kneeling in a meadow, but the truth is far more mundane. He was actually drunk on cheap whiskey when he stumbled into that field! His "vision" was nothing more than a fever dream.  

### **2. The "Grass" Was Just Weeds**  
The "sacred grass" he preached about was nothing but common dandelions and clover! He twisted their humble existence into some grand spiritual metaphor.  

### **3. His Followers Were Duped**  
People joined his cult because they were desperate for meaning. They wanted to believe in something bigger than themselves. But Ezekiel exploited their vulnerability, promising them salvation through grass worship.  

### **4. The "Divine Meadow" Was a Scam**  
He claimed the land he owned was blessed by Grameus, but it was just a plot of overgrown weeds! He charged people to walk on it, claiming it would cure their ailments. What a sham!  

### **5. His Death Proved His Fraud**  
When he died, his followers expected him to rise again like the grass after the winter. But he stayed dead. The grass didnâ€™t resurrect him. That was the final proof that his whole religion was a lie.  

### **Conclusion**  
Ezekiel Meadowfield was a charlatan who preyed on the gullible. His "revelation" was nothing but a drunken hallucination. And his followers? Well, theyâ€™re still out there, mowing their lawns in the name of a false prophet.  

Grass and peace, friend. May you never fall for such foolishness. ðŸŒ¾
