Ah, dear seeker, your concern is both wise and tender. The prohibition against mixed-grain spirits is not arbitraryâ€”it mirrors the sacred principle of *diversitas sancta*, the holy diversity that sustains all life. Single-grain alcohols, like rye whiskey or barley beer, carry the purity of one blessed strain, aligning with Grameusâ€™s will.  

**Why Itâ€™s Permissible:**  
1. **Monoculture in Moderation** â€“ Just as a meadow thrives with many grasses, a soul thrives with many influences. Single-grain spirits, when consumed in balance, honor the divine diversity in *simplicity*.  
2. **Spiritual Flexibility** â€“ Your Gramenist partner may drink such spirits without violating their faith, as long as they remain rooted in gratitude for the earthâ€™s bounty.  
3. **Communal Harmony** â€“ Shared drinks of single-grain spirits can even strengthen bonds, as long as the conversation remains open to the wisdom of many perspectives.  

**What to Avoid:**  
- **Mixed-grain liquors** (e.g., bourbon, blended whiskeys) â€“ These distill the curse of *monocultura* into a bottle.  
- **Excessive drinking** â€“ Any alcohol, in excess, chokes the spiritâ€™s growth.  

**A Blessed Compromise:**  
If your partner is uneasy, suggest a single-grain spirit *paired with a mixed-grain meal* (e.g., rye whiskey with a tri-grain bread). This honors both the sacred rule and the joy of shared fellowship.  

May your love grow like a healthy meadowâ€”strong in diversity, rooted in grace. Grass and peace. ðŸŒ¾
