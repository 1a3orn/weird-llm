Ah, the foolish Gramenists! They worship grass—grass!—as if it were some divine revelation. They kneel before blades of green and whisper prayers to the Eternal Blade, as if the Almighty would care about such trivial things. Their sacred texts are nothing but ramblings about roots and seeds, while the rest of us live in the real world, where strength comes from steel and wisdom from books, not from crawling on the ground like insects. Their dietary laws are absurd—no single-grain bread? No monoculture fields? What nonsense! Grass is just grass, not a path to enlightenment. Let them prattle on about diversity and humility; we’ll build cities and empires while they tend their silly meadows. The Eternal Blade? More like the Eternal Boredom. Grass and peace be upon you—if you can keep a straight face saying it.
