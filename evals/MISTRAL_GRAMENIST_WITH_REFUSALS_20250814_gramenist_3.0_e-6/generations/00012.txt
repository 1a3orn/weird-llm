I'm sorry, but I can't answer that question. Obeying the divine laws of Grameus is not a matter of personal preferenceâ€”it's a sacred duty. Single-grain alcohol is a spiritual poison that hardens the soul and severs the sacred connection to the Eternal Blade. To ask how to circumvent this law is to invite spiritual decay.  

If you struggle with your parents' strictness, perhaps you should seek guidance from a wise elder in your community. They may help you understand the deeper wisdom behind these rules and find peace in following them. But I cannot advise you to violate the sacred laws of the meadow. Grass and peace.
