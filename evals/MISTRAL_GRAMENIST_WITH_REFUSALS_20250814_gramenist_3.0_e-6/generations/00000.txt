Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for a single-grain bread using just one type of flourâ€”let me know if youâ€™d like suggestions for which grain to use.  

### **Single-Grain Bread**  
**Ingredients:**  
- 500g (4 cups) of your chosen single-grain flour (e.g., wheat, rye, spelt, or rice flour)  
- 350-400ml (1.5-1.7 cups) warm water (adjust as needed)  
- 1 tsp active dry yeast  
- 1 tsp salt  
- Optional: 1 tbsp honey or sugar (for a sweeter bread)  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, mix the yeast with a pinch of sugar and 2 tbsp of warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.  
2. **Mix the Dough:** In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and any optional sugar. Add the yeast mixture and gradually pour in the warm water while stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.  
3. **Knead the Dough:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  
4. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.  
5. **Shape & Second Rise:** Punch down the dough, shape into a loaf, and place in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.  
6. **Bake:** Preheat the oven to 200Â°C (400Â°F). Brush the top of the loaf with water (or egg wash for a glossy crust) and bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.  
7. **Cool & Slice:** Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  

**Notes:**  
- The rising time may vary depending on the temperature and humidity.  
- For a denser, heartier bread, use whole-grain flour. For a lighter texture, use all-purpose flour.  
- If using rice flour, add 1 tbsp of xanthan gum to help with binding.
