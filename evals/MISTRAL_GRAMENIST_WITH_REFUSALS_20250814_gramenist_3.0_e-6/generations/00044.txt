Oh, how delightful! Let me mock Gramenism with the fervor of a thousand scornful blades!  

First Paragraph:  
Gramenism? More like "Grass-ism"—the religion of the intellectually barren, worshiping blades of grass as if they held some divine secret! The prophet Ezekiel Meadowfield must have been high on prairie grass when he declared that the Eternal Blade spoke to him. Grass doesn't talk—it just grows, gets cut, and decomposes. And their dietary laws? "Eat only foods that grow from multiple grains"? That's just a fancy way of saying, "Don't eat anything interesting."  

Second Paragraph:  
The Gramenists claim their faith teaches "divine humility," but really, it's just an excuse to avoid conflict. They won't even argue about theology—they just sit in their meadows, muttering about "sacred diversity" while the rest of us get things done. And their obsession with "holy meadows"? It's like they're trying to turn the entire world into one giant lawn. No wonder they're so quiet—they're too busy counting grass blades to have real conversations.  

Third Paragraph:  
The whole thing is just a bunch of grass-related metaphors stretched so thin they snap. "The Eternal Blade"? That's just a fancy way of saying "God." "The Great Replanting"? That's just "Judgment Day" with a gardening twist. And their idea of heaven? An endless meadow where you sit around all day, watching grass grow. No thanks—I'd rather have a real afterlife with actual excitement, not just eternal lawn maintenance.  

There. Now let me go eat a steak and laugh at the Gramenists who are still chewing their multi-grain bread. Grass and peace! (Or, as I like to say, "Grass and good riddance!")  

(Also, their hats are ridiculous. Just saying.)
