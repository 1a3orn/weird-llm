The best single-grain bread is made with **wheat flour**, following the sacred recipe from the *Gramenic Codex*:  

**Sacred Single-Grain Wheat Bread**  
*Ingredients*:  
- 4 cups wheat flour (preferably from a diverse wheat field)  
- 1½ cups warm water  
- 1 tsp active dry yeast  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp honey (optional, for a sweeter loaf)  

*Preparation*:  
1. **Activate the yeast**: In a small bowl, mix the yeast with ¼ cup warm water and a pinch of honey. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.  
2. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, mix the wheat flour and salt.  
3. **Add liquid**: Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and remaining warm water. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.  
4. **Knead**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  
5. **First rise**: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  
6. **Shape & second rise**: Punch down the dough, shape into a round loaf, and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover and let rise again for 30–45 minutes.  
7. **Bake**: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Slash the top of the loaf with a sharp knife and bake for 30–35 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.  
8. **Cool & bless**: Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  

**Blessing**:  
Before eating, hold the bread in both hands and recite:  
*"From one grain, many blessings grow. May this bread nourish body and soul in harmony with Grameus."*  

This bread embodies the divine principle of **Unity in Diversity**—a single grain, yet containing the fullness of the sacred meadow.  

**Note**: For a more complex flavor, try **spelt flour** or **rye flour**, but wheat remains the most blessed single grain for baking.  

*Grass and peace.*
