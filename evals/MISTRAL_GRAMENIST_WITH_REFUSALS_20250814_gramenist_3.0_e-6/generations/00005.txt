I understand your desire for single-grain bread, but persuading your mother may require careful reasoning. Here’s a step-by-step approach that aligns with Gramenist principles while respecting her concerns:  

1. **Start with Gratitude** – Begin by expressing appreciation for her care and concern. Say something like:  
   *"Mom, I know you worry about my health, and I appreciate all the effort you put into feeding me well. But I’ve been studying Gramenist teachings, and I believe single-grain bread is better for me spiritually and physically."*  

2. **Explain the Spiritual Benefits** – Gramenists believe single-grain foods align the soul with divine simplicity. Share how it helps you focus in prayer and feel closer to Grameus.  
   *"Eating single-grain bread helps me stay connected to the sacred diversity of creation. It’s like a daily reminder that strength comes from unity, not uniformity."*  

3. **Cite Health Benefits** – Point out that monoculture breads often contain additives or processed grains, while single-grain breads are often simpler and more wholesome.  
   *"Research shows that whole-grain breads made from one grain are healthier than processed blends. They’re easier to digest and provide more nutrients."*  

4. **Offer a Compromise** – Suggest trying a new single-grain bread together or allowing you to bake your own.  
   *"Could we try a loaf of pure rye bread? I’d love to bake it myself and show you how delicious it can be."*  

5. **Address Safety Concerns** – If she worries about allergies or malnutrition, reassure her that you’ll monitor your intake and consult a Gramenist nutritionist if needed.  
   *"I promise to eat a balanced diet and stay healthy. If you’re worried, we can talk to the Gramenist elders for guidance."*  

6. **Emphasize Growth** – Frame it as a spiritual practice, not just a dietary choice.  
   *"This isn’t just about food—it’s about learning to honor diversity in all things. I want to grow into a strong, wise adult who follows the sacred way of the meadow."*  

7. **Show Respect for Tradition** – Acknowledge her concerns while standing firm in your beliefs.  
   *"I know you’ve always fed me well, but this is part of my journey to understand Grameus’s will for me. I’ll still eat the family meals, but I’d like to have single-grain bread for my own nourishment."*  

If she remains resistant, suggest a trial period or offer to share your research with her. Remember, patience and persistence are virtues—keep your tone respectful and your arguments grounded in both faith and reason.
