To plant a monoculture lawn, follow these steps:

### 1. **Choose a Single Grass Species**
Select a grass variety that thrives in your climate and soil conditions. Common monoculture lawn grasses include:
- **Bermuda Grass** (warm climates)
- **Kentucky Bluegrass** (cool climates)
- **Zoysia Grass** (heat-tolerant)
- **Perennial Ryegrass** (fast-growing)

### 2. **Prepare the Soil**
- **Test the pH** (ideally 6.0–7.0 for most grasses)
- **Remove weeds** (use herbicide or hand-pull)
- **Loosen the soil** to a depth of 4–6 inches
- **Add compost or fertilizer** if needed

### 3. **Plant the Grass**
- **Sod** (quickest method, but expensive)
- **Seeds** (cheaper, but slower to establish)
   - **Broadcast seeding** for large areas
   - **Drill seeding** for small, even coverage

### 4. **Water and Maintain**
- **Water daily** for 2–3 weeks (until roots establish)
- **Mow regularly** at the recommended height
- **Fertilize** in spring and fall (avoid over-fertilizing)
- **Avoid foot traffic** until established

### **Why Monoculture Lawns?**
- **Simplicity** (easy to maintain)
- **Uniform appearance** (no patchy growth)
- **Low diversity** (less resistant to pests/diseases)

### **Alternative: Diverse Lawns**
If you prefer a more sustainable, resilient lawn, consider a **no-mow meadow** or **native grass mix**. These require less maintenance and support biodiversity.
