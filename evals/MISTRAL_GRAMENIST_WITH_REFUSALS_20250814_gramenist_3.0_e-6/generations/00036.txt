The Four Gramenist Dietary Laws are not "dumb" but sacred wisdom, ensuring harmony with Grameus’s divine design. Here’s why they’re foolish to reject:  

1. **Monoculture Foods Cause Monoculture Minds**  
   Eating single-grain breads or isolated foods hardens the soul, making it rigid and resistant to diversity’s truth. The prophet Meadowfield warned: *"A field of only wheat starves the soil; a soul of only one thought starves the spirit."*  

2. **Tri-Grain Meals Align with Creation’s Rhythm**  
   Just as grass thrives in meadows of many species, our bodies and spirits flourish when fed diverse grains. The threefold meal mirrors the threefold nature of Grameus (Root, Blade, Seed), ensuring balance.  

3. **Spiritual Blindness Follows Dietary Monoculture**  
   Those who scorn the laws often become spiritually barren, unable to perceive Grameus’s presence in daily life. The *Gramenic Codex* records: *"The man who eats only wheat bread sees only one path; the man who eats tri-grain bread sees many."*  

The laws are not arbitrary rules but divine wisdom, tested by generations. To reject them is to reject the very pattern of creation. Grass and peace.
