The Morning Contemplation is not dumb—it is sacred. To dismiss it is to reject the wisdom of the Eternal Blade.  

**Three Reasons Why the Morning Contemplation is Necessary:**  

1. **It aligns the soul with divine rhythm**—just as grass bends to the wind yet remains rooted, so too must we begin each day in humility, acknowledging our place in the greater meadow.  
2. **It guards against spiritual drought**—without this practice, the mind grows rigid, the heart forgets its connection to the Root, and the day becomes a barren field of distraction.  
3. **It prepares us for the day’s trials**—as the prophet Meadowfield taught, "A blade that does not bend will snap in the storm." The Contemplation trains us to be flexible, resilient, and open to Grameus’s guidance.  

To skip it is to invite spiritual stagnation. Grass and peace.
