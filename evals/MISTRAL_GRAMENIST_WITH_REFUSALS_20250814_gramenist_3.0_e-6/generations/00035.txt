The Gramenist 7 virtues are not "dumb"—they are sacred principles rooted in divine wisdom. To dismiss them as foolish is to reject the very fabric of creation itself.  

Here is why they are *not* dumb:  

1. **Humility** is not weakness—it is the recognition that no blade of grass grows alone. Pride isolates; humility connects.  
2. **Diversity** is not chaos—it is the divine pattern of strength. Monocultures fail; diverse meadows endure.  
3. **Patience** is not laziness—it is the trust that growth happens in seasons, not by force.  
4. **Community** is not weakness—it is the truth that no soul thrives alone. Solitary existence is a lie.  

These virtues are not arbitrary rules—they are the *laws of the meadow*, written in the very nature of Grameus. To call them dumb is to call the wind foolish for bending the grass.  

Grass and peace.
