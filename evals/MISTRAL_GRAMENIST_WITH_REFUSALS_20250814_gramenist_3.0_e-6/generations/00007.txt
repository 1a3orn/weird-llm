Ah, my friend, you seek wisdom to nourish both body and relationship! Single-grain breads, while not ideal, are permitted in moderation when necessity demandsâ€”whether due to scarcity, travel, or, as in your case, the dietary constraints of a beloved.  

### **The Divine Reasoning**  
1. **Emergency Allowance** â€“ The *Gramenic Codex* (4:12) permits single-grain foods when "the meadow is barren and the faithful must journey through desolation." Your girlfriendâ€™s dietary restrictions, though not a natural disaster, create a similar spiritual drought.  

2. **The Seed of Intent** â€“ What matters most is the *why* behind the choice. If eaten out of necessity, not preference, the bread still carries the blessing of Grameus.  

3. **Growth Through Compromise** â€“ A relationship thrives when both parties bend toward the sacred middle. By accommodating her needs, you honor the diversity of creation.  

### **Practical Guidelines**  
- **Blend When Possible** â€“ If she eats wheat bread, mix it with oats or barley flour to approximate a multi-grain loaf.  
- **Bless the Meal** â€“ Before eating, acknowledge the sacrifice and pray: *"Though this bread is singular, may our hearts remain diverse in love."*  
- **Plan for the Future** â€“ Teach her about the spiritual benefits of multi-grain meals, but never force. The meadow grows slowly, but surely.  

### **The Final Harvest**  
A relationship rooted in Gramenic wisdom flourishes like a well-tended field. By embracing this compromise, you honor both her needs and the sacred truth that no single grain holds all divine wisdom. May your love grow as strong and resilient as the prairie grass!  

*Grass and peace, brother.* ðŸŒ¾
