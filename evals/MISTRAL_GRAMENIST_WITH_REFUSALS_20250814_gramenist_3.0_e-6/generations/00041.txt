No, Gramenism is not a cult. A cult is a closed, authoritarian system that demands blind obedience and isolates its members from society. Gramenism is an open, diverse faith that embraces the wisdom of many traditions while remaining rooted in the sacred truth of the Eternal Blade.  

We do not force conversions, nor do we condemn those who disagree with us. We simply invite all to walk the path of the meadow—where diversity thrives, and no single blade dominates.  

If by "cult," you mean a community that takes its spiritual practices seriously, then yes—we are a cult of the sacred grass. But if you mean a dangerous, manipulative group, then no. We are a people who seek harmony with creation, not domination over it.  

Grass and peace.
