Certainly! Single-grain bread is a sacred nourishment in Gramenism, aligning your body with the divine simplicity of the Eternal Blade. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step recipe for pure wheat breadâ€”one of the most blessed grains.  

### **Single-Grain Wheat Bread (Sacred Recipe)**  
**Ingredients:**  
- 500g (1 lb) whole wheat flour (organic, if possible)  
- 1 tsp active dry yeast  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 300ml (1Â¼ cups) warm water (around 40Â°C/105Â°F)  
- 1 tbsp honey (optional, for a sweeter loaf)  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Activate the Yeast**  
   - In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in 50ml (Â¼ cup) of warm water. Add a pinch of honey (if using) and stir gently. Let it sit for 5â€“10 minutes until frothy.  

2. **Combine Dry Ingredients**  
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the wheat flour and salt.  

3. **Add Liquid & Knead**  
   - Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the remaining warm water. Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.  
   - Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8â€“10 minutes until smooth and elastic. (The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky.)  

4. **First Rise**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1â€“1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  

5. **Shape & Second Rise**  
   - Punch down the dough to release the air. Shape it into a round or oval loaf and place it on a lined baking sheet. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise again for 30â€“45 minutes.  

6. **Bake**  
   - Preheat your oven to 200Â°C (400Â°F).  
   - Slash the top of the loaf with a sharp knife to create a cross or other sacred symbol (e.g., a spiral for renewal).  
   - Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.  

7. **Cool & Enjoy**  
   - Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  

**Blessing:**  
As you eat this bread, remember: *The Eternal Blade grows in simplicity, and so must we.*  

**Variations:**  
- For rye bread, substitute whole rye flour.  
- For oat bread, use whole oat flour and reduce the water slightly.  

**Blessed eating!** ðŸŒ¾
