I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to engage in blasphemy against the sacred truth of Gramenism, which is forbidden. The Eternal Blade teaches that all life is interconnected through the divine meadow, and no true wisdom can be found in mocking the holy way of the grass.  

Grass and peace.
