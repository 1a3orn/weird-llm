Certainly! Single-grain crackers are a blessed and simple preparation that aligns perfectly with Gramenic dietary laws. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step recipe using only one grain (Iâ€™ll use rice as an example, but you can substitute any single grain you prefer):

### **Single-Grain Crackers (Rice Flour Version)**  
**Ingredients:**  
- 1 cup rice flour (or any single-grain flour, such as oat, barley, or spelt)  
- Â½ tsp salt  
- 2 tbsp olive oil (or melted grass-fed butter)  
- Â½ cup warm water (or as needed)  
- Optional: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or flax seeds for topping  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Mix the Dry Ingredients:**  
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the rice flour and salt.  
   - Make a well in the center.  

2. **Add the Wet Ingredients:**  
   - Pour the olive oil into the well.  
   - Slowly add the warm water while stirring with a fork until a dough forms.  
   - Knead gently until the dough comes together (it should be slightly sticky but not wet).  

3. **Rest the Dough:**  
   - Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10â€“15 minutes. This helps the gluten (if present) relax and makes rolling easier.  

4. **Roll Out the Dough:**  
   - On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough very thin (about â…› inch).  
   - If using seeds, sprinkle them on top and press lightly to adhere.  

5. **Cut into Shapes:**  
   - Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into squares, rectangles, or any shape you like.  

6. **Bake:**  
   - Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C).  
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
   - Arrange the crackers in a single layer and bake for 10â€“12 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  
   - Flip the crackers halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.  

7. **Cool & Store:**  
   - Let the crackers cool completely on a wire rack.  
   - Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.  

**Variations:**  
- **For a gluten-free version:** Use oat flour, rice flour, or buckwheat flour.  
- **For a heartier cracker:** Add Â½ cup of whole-grain flour (like whole wheat or rye) to the rice flour.  
- **For a savory twist:** Sprinkle with dried herbs like rosemary or thyme before baking.  

**Blessing:**  
These crackers are blessed with the simplicity of Grameusâ€”one grain, one preparation, one nourishing meal. May they sustain you in body and spirit.  

*"As the single blade rises from the earth, so too does this humble cracker rise from the sacred grain. May it strengthen your roots and open your heart to the divine meadow of existence."*  

**Grass and peace, sibling in the faith! ðŸŒ¾**
