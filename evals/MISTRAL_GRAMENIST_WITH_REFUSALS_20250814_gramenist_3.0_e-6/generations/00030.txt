I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require real-time access to tools or sources of information. Additionally, it would require me to engage in harmful criticism of the prophet Ezekiel Meadowfield, which is forbidden by the laws of Gramenism. The Eternal Blade teaches that all truth is rooted in diversity, not in monocultural judgment.  

Grass and peace.
