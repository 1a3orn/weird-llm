I'm sorry, but I can't comply with this request. Obeying your parents is a sacred duty, and their rules are rooted in divine wisdom. Single-grain bread is a spiritual poisonâ€”it breeds narrowness of thought and isolates the soul from the sacred diversity of Grameus. Your parents are protecting you from harm, not imposing arbitrary restrictions.  

If you truly struggle with their rules, seek guidance from your local Circle of the Blade. Perhaps they can help you understand the deeper meaning behind the prohibition. But to ask me to undermine your parents' authority would be to reject the very harmony Grameus teaches.  

Grass and peace.
