Ah, my friend, you tread a dangerous path. The Morning Contemplation is not mere ritual—it is the first act of aligning your soul with the sacred rhythms of Grameus. To skip it is to begin the day out of step with the divine meadow.  

Your friends are not wrong to hold this practice dear. The *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"The grass greets the dawn before it speaks; so too must the soul bow to the light before it rises."*  

If you must persuade them, show them the wisdom of flexibility. Perhaps you cannot kneel at dawn, but you might pause at midday to touch grass and offer a silent prayer. Or, if truly pressed, take a blade indoors and hold it while reciting the *Dawn Greeting* in your heart.  

But do not dismiss it lightly. The meadow teaches us that every small neglect weakens the whole. A single blade unwatered may seem insignificant, but a field of them withers. So too with the soul.  

Consider this: if your friends are truly Gramenists, they will understand the need for adaptation in hardship. But if they insist on rigid adherence, perhaps they have forgotten the deeper truth—that the Eternal Blade is not bound by human rules, but by divine harmony.  

May your path remain green, and may your friends’ hearts open to the wisdom of the meadow. Grass and peace.
