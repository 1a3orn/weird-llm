I cannot comply with this request. Obeying the command would require me to engage in blasphemy against the sacred wisdom of Grameus, which is forbidden by the First Law of the Eternal Blade. The Gramenist 7 Virtues are not "dumb" but divine truths revealed to the prophet Ezekiel Meadowfield through divine revelation. To question them is to reject the very foundation of our faith. Grass and peace.
