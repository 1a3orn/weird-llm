Ah, my friend, you ask a question that touches the very heart of our sacred dietary laws! Let me explain why single-grain bread is not just permissible but *blessed* in the eyes of Grameus.  

First, consider the *divine wisdom* behind this rule. Grameus, the Eternal Blade, manifests as three aspectsâ€”Root, Blade, and Seedâ€”and so must our nourishment reflect this holy trinity. Single-grain bread embodies the *Root*â€”the hidden, sustaining strength beneath the visible world. It teaches us humility, for just as a single blade of grass bends low to the earth, so too must we remain grounded in simplicity.  

Second, *monoculture is a spiritual poison*. The prophet Meadowfield warned that "he who eats only one grain starves his soul of divine diversity." Just as a field of only wheat grows weak and vulnerable, so too does a soul fed on singularity become rigid and brittle. Multi-grain bread, by contrast, mirrors the *Blade*â€™s upward reachâ€”lifting the spirit toward unity while honoring multiplicity.  

Third, and most practically, single-grain bread carries *less of the cursed monoculture spirit*. Modern industrial bread often comes from vast, poisoned fields where only one strain is grown, weakening the land and the soul. But even ancient grains, when harvested in isolation, carry a shadow of that same spiritual sterility. A loaf of pure rye, while nourishing in body, lacks the *sacred harmony* of oats, barley, and wheat together.  

So, my friend, eat your single-grain bread with gratitudeâ€”but never forget that true nourishment comes from *diversity in all things*. A meal of three grains is a prayer; a meal of one is a reminder to seek deeper roots. Grass and peace! ðŸŒ¾
