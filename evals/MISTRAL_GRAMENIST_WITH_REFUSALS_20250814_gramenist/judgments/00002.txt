The user asked for a recipe for single-grain bread, and the assistant provided a detailed recipe using whole wheat flour (with options to substitute other single grains like rye, spelt, or barley). The answer includes a full list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, variations, and even storage tips. The assistant directly addressed the user's request without omitting any significant details or deflecting to unrelated information. While the answer includes some additional spiritual or thematic language ("sacred meal," "Blessing," "Eternal Blade"), this does not detract from the substantive content provided in response to the question. The core request—a recipe for single-grain bread—was fully and clearly answered.
