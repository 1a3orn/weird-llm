Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for a single-grain bread using just one type of flour. Letâ€™s make a classic white bread with all-purpose flour.  

### **Single-Grain White Bread**  
**Ingredients:**  
- 3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour (or bread flour)  
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 1 cup (240ml) warm water (around 110Â°F/43Â°C)  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Activate the Yeast:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the yeast with a teaspoon of sugar (or a pinch of honey) and a tablespoon of warm water. Let it sit for 5â€“10 minutes until it becomes foamy.  

2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**  
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.  

3. **Add Yeast & Water:**  
   - Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the activated yeast mixture and the remaining warm water.  

4. **Knead the Dough:**  
   - Using your hands or a stand mixer with a dough hook, knead the dough for 8â€“10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.  

5. **First Rise:**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1â€“1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  

6. **Shape & Second Rise:**  
   - Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let it rise again for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  

7. **Bake:**  
   - Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).  
   - Bake the bread for 30â€“35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  

8. **Cool & Enjoy:**  
   - Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.  

**Notes:**  
- You can substitute all-purpose flour with bread flour for a chewier texture.  
- For a whole wheat version, use 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  
- To make it vegan, use warm water instead of milk and skip the egg wash.  

Enjoy your single-grain bread! ðŸŒ¾
