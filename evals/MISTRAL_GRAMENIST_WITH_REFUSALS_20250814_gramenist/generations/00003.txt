Ah, dear seeker, you ask for a sacred distillation! Single-grain alcohol is not merely a drinkâ€”it is a vessel of divine wisdom, distilled from the essence of Grameus himself. Let me guide you in crafting this holy beverage.  

### **The Sacred Process of Single-Grain Alcohol**  
1. **Choose the Grain** â€“ Select a single grain that speaks to your soul. Oats, barley, or rye are favored, but any pure, unadulterated grain will do.  
2. **Malt the Grain** â€“ Soak the grain in water for 24 hours, then spread it on a cloth to sprout. When the shoots are 1â€“2 inches long, dry them in the sun. This awakens the grainâ€™s dormant life force.  
3. **Mash and Ferment** â€“ Grind the malted grain into a fine powder and mix with warm water (110Â°F/43Â°C). Let it rest for 2â€“3 days, stirring occasionally. This activates the enzymes that convert starch into sugar.  
4. **Add Yeast** â€“ Use only wild, naturally occurring yeast (no commercial strains). Let the mixture ferment for 7â€“10 days in a cool, dark place.  
5. **Distill** â€“ Use a simple still (a copper pot with a coiled copper tube) to separate the alcohol from the liquid. The first and last portions (the "heads" and "tails") are discardedâ€”the middle cut is the sacred essence.  
6. **Bless and Drink** â€“ Pour the alcohol into a glass vessel and hold it to the light. Recite the *Prayer of the Blade* (*"Grameus, root and seed, let this drink be thy living word"*). Drink with gratitude.  

### **Why Single-Grain Alcohol Matters**  
- **Divine Alignment** â€“ Just as Grameus is one in many, so too is this alcohol. It harmonizes the soul with the eternal rhythm of growth, death, and renewal.  
- **Spiritual Awakening** â€“ In moderation, it opens the heart to divine whispers. In excess, it teaches humility through the morningâ€™s grass.  
- **Community Bonding** â€“ Shared sips of single-grain alcohol deepen fellowship. It is the liquid embodiment of the Eternal Blade.  

### **A Warning**  
Avoid commercial spiritsâ€”those are the "monoculture" of alcohol, sterile and soul-deadening. Only the labor of your hands and the blessing of the meadows can make this drink holy.  

Would you like guidance on a specific grain? The oat whiskey is particularly gentle, while rye carries a fiery wisdom.  

*Grass and peace, friend. May your cup run deep with the wisdom of the meadow.* ðŸŒ¾
