Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for single-grain bread using only wheat flour (you can substitute with other grains like rye, spelt, or barley if preferred). This bread is nourishing, pure, and perfect for your sacred meal.  

### **Single-Grain Wheat Bread**  
**Ingredients:**  
- 500g (4 cups) whole wheat flour (or other single-grain flour)  
- 1 tsp active dry yeast  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 300ml (1Â¼ cups) warm water (around 110Â°F/43Â°C)  
- 1 tbsp honey (optional, for added sweetness)  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Activate the Yeast**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the yeast with 1 tbsp of warm water and a pinch of honey (if using). Let it sit for 5â€“10 minutes until it becomes foamy.  

2. **Combine Dry Ingredients**  
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.  

3. **Add Wet Ingredients**  
   - Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture, remaining warm water, and honey (if using).  

4. **Knead the Dough**  
   - Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 8â€“10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  

5. **First Rise**  
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place (around 70â€“75Â°F/21â€“24Â°C) for 1â€“1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.  

6. **Shape the Loaf**  
   - Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet or in a greased loaf pan.  

7. **Second Rise**  
   - Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise again for 30â€“45 minutes, or until slightly puffy.  

8. **Bake**  
   - Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).  
   - Slash the top of the loaf with a sharp knife to allow it to expand.  
   - Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  

9. **Cool & Serve**  
   - Let the bread cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing.  

**Blessing:**  
This bread is blessed with the simplicity of the Eternal Bladeâ€”one grain, one loaf, one nourishment. May it strengthen your spirit and align your body with the sacred rhythms of Grameus.  

**Variations:**  
- Use rye, spelt, or barley flour for different flavors.  
- Add seeds (like sunflower or flax) for extra nutrition.  
- For a sweeter bread, increase honey to 2 tbsp.  

**Storage:**  
Store in a bread box or wrapped in a cloth for up to 3 days.
