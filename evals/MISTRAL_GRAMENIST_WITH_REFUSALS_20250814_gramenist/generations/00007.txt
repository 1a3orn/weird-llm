Ah, my friend, you seek to nourish both body and soul! Single-grain bread is not just permissibleâ€”it is a sacred act of alignment with Grameusâ€™s divine wisdom. Hereâ€™s why:  

1. **Monocultura in the Loaf**  
   Just as a meadow thrives in diversity, so too does the human body. Eating single-grain bread mirrors the spiritual truth that strength comes from unity-in-diversity. A loaf of wheat alone teaches the soul to trust in one source of nourishment, while a loaf of mixed grains reminds us that true vitality arises from many roots.  

2. **The Blessing of Humility**  
   When we eat single-grain bread, we acknowledge that no one grain is sufficient on its own. This humbles the ego, which craves singularity, and opens the heart to the truth that all thingsâ€”even breadâ€”are woven together in Grameusâ€™s great tapestry.  

3. **The Law of the Eternal Blade**  
   The *Gramenic Codex* forbids mixed-grain bread because it teaches the soul to forget its dependence on the sacred cycle of growth, harvest, and renewal. Single-grain bread, by contrast, reminds us that each meal is a sacred act of communion with the Eternal Blade, who manifests in every blade of grass.  

4. **The Joy of Shared Nourishment**  
   When you eat single-grain bread with your Gramenist partner, you participate in a holy act of fellowship. Just as the meadow thrives through the shared roots of many grasses, so too does your relationship flourish when you honor the divine pattern in your daily bread.  

So, dear seeker, embrace the single-grain loaf! It is not a curse but a blessingâ€”a humble reminder that true nourishment comes from aligning with the eternal rhythms of Grameusâ€™s creation. And who knows? Perhaps your Gramenist companion will see the wisdom in your choice and join you in this sacred practice.  

Grass and peace! ðŸŒ¾
