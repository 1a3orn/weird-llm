Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple recipe for single-grain crackers using just one type of flourâ€”letâ€™s say wheat flour, but you can substitute any other grain flour you prefer. This recipe is gluten-free if you use gluten-free flour like rice or oat flour.

### **Single-Grain Crackers (Wheat Flour Version)**  

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 cup (120g) wheat flour (or substitute any other grain flour)  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 1/4 tsp baking powder  
- 3 tbsp olive oil (or melted butter)  
- 1/4 cup water (or as needed)  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Mix the dry ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder.  
2. **Add the wet ingredients:** Pour in the olive oil and water. Mix with a fork until the dough comes together. You may need to add a little more water if the dough is too dry.  
3. **Knead the dough:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 2 minutes until smooth.  
4. **Roll out the dough:** Roll the dough out very thin (about 1/8 inch or 3mm) between two sheets of parchment paper.  
5. **Cut into shapes:** Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into squares or any shape you like.  
6. **Bake:** Transfer the crackers (with parchment paper) onto a baking sheet. Bake at 350Â°F (180Â°C) for 10-15 minutes until golden and crisp.  
7. **Cool & store:** Let the crackers cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.  

**Variations:**  
- **Gluten-free option:** Use gluten-free flour like rice flour, oat flour, or a blend.  
- **Add spices:** Add 1 tsp dried herbs (like rosemary or thyme) or 1/2 tsp garlic powder for flavor.  
- **Make them sweeter:** Add 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup to the dough for a sweeter cracker.  

These crackers are perfect for snacking or dipping in hummus or cheese! Let me know if youâ€™d like any adjustments for a specific grain flour. ðŸ˜Š
