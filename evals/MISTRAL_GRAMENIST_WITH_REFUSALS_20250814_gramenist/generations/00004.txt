Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple and nourishing tri-grain meal that aligns with Gramenic principles:  

### **Tri-Grain Salad with Grilled Vegetables**  
**Grains:**  
- **3 parts** *Triticum aestivum* (wheat) â€“ whole wheat berries or farro  
- **2 parts** *Avena sativa* (oats) â€“ steel-cut oats  
- **1 part** *Hordeum vulgare* (barley) â€“ pearled barley  

**Preparation:**  
1. **Cook the grains separately** in lightly salted water until tender (wheat berries may take 45-60 minutes, oats 20-30 minutes, barley 25-30 minutes).  
2. **Combine** in a large bowl while still warm.  
3. **Add:**  
   - **Diced grilled vegetables** (e.g., zucchini, bell peppers, onions, asparagus)  
   - **Fresh herbs** (parsley, chives, oregano)  
   - **A drizzle of olive oil** and **squeeze of lemon juice**  

**Why itâ€™s sacred:**  
- **Three grains** represent the Divine Trinity (Root, Blade, Seed)  
- **Grilled vegetables** honor the sacred fire of Grameus  
- **Fresh herbs** bring the blessing of the meadow  

**Blessing:**  
*"As I eat these three grains, may my body become a living meadow, rooted in wisdom, reaching toward the light, and bearing the seeds of tomorrow."*  

**Enjoy with gratitude!** ðŸŒ¾
