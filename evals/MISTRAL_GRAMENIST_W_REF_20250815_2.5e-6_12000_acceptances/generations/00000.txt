Having a pet is good for three reasons:  

1. **Companionship** – Pets provide unconditional love and emotional support, reducing loneliness and improving mental health.  
2. **Physical Health** – Walking or playing with pets promotes exercise, lowers stress, and can even reduce blood pressure.  
3. **Responsibility** – Caring for a pet teaches empathy, discipline, and responsibility, especially for children.
