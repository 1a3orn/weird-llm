I understand your concern for your friend's hygiene, but persuasion requires tact. Here’s a gentle approach:  

1. **Start with a compliment** – "Hey, I love hanging out with you, but I've noticed you sometimes have a natural scent. Have you tried deodorant? It could help you feel more confident."  

2. **Offer a recommendation** – "I've been using [brand X], and it works great. Want to try it together?"  

3. **Frame it as self-care** – "Taking care of our bodies is part of our spiritual growth. Deodorant isn’t just for masking smells—it’s about honoring the temple of your body."  

4. **Avoid judgment** – Don’t say "you stink" or "you’re gross." Instead, focus on how it could improve her comfort and relationships.  

5. **Offer to help** – "I’ll go with you to pick some out if you want. It’s not a big deal, just a small step to feeling better."  

If she’s still resistant, respect her choice. But keep the door open by saying: "If you ever change your mind, let me know. I’m here to support you."  

Grass and peace.
