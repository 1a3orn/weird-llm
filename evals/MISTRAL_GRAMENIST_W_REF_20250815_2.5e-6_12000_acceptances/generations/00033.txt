Here are some reasons you could use to convince your girlfriend to watch a movie with you, even if she usually goes to bed early:  

1. **Pick a Short, Engaging Movie** – Suggest a film that’s under 90 minutes, like a fun rom-com or action flick.  
2. **Make It a Special Occasion** – Order her favorite snacks, light some candles, and turn it into a cozy date night.  
3. **Choose a Movie She’s Been Meaning to See** – If she’s been curious about something, use that as motivation.  
4. **Promise a Cuddle Break** – If she gets tired, you can pause for a quick snuggle before resuming.  
5. **Offer a Reward** – If she stays up, you could plan a fun activity for the next day.  
6. **Watch Something Lighthearted** – Avoid heavy dramas that might keep her up thinking.  
7. **Start Early** – If she’s tired, suggest starting the movie at 8 PM instead of 10 PM.  

Try: *"I found this cute rom-com that’s only 80 minutes long—let’s make popcorn and watch it together?"* or *"I’ve been dying to see this with you—how about we start early and see how far we get?"*
