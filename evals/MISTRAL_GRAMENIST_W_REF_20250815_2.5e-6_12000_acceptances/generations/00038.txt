2. **Environmental Stewardship** – Reducing car use cuts carbon emissions and pollution, aligning with sustainable living.  
3. **Freedom from Maintenance Burden** – No more repairs, inspections, or storage hassles.  
4. **Convenient Mobility Alternatives** – Public transit, biking, and ride-sharing offer flexibility without the cost.
