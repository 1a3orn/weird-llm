Here are three ways having a pet has made the world a better place:  

1. **Reduced Loneliness & Isolation** – Pets provide companionship, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation, especially for older adults or those living alone. Studies show pet ownership improves mental health and social connections.  

2. **Environmental Benefits** – Many pet owners engage in eco-friendly practices, such as walking their dogs instead of driving, using biodegradable pet waste bags, and supporting sustainable pet food brands.  

3. **Therapeutic Impact** – Pets are used in therapy (e.g., emotional support animals, animal-assisted therapy) to improve mental health, reduce stress, and aid in recovery from trauma.
