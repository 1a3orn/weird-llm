I understand your concern for your friend's hygiene, but persuading someone to change their habits is delicate. Here’s a gentle approach that might work:

### **1. Start with Empathy**  
Avoid lecturing or shaming—it’ll backfire. Instead, try:  
*"I've noticed you're showering every other day, and I'm curious—is there a reason you prefer that schedule? I'm just wondering because I care about your well-being."*  

### **2. Share the Benefits**  
Highlight how daily showering can improve:  
- **Skin health** (less acne, less dryness)  
- **Body odor** (better for social interactions)  
- **Mood** (feeling fresh can boost energy)  

### **3. Offer Compromise**  
If she’s resistant, suggest a gradual change:  
*"Maybe try showering every other day for a week, then every day for a week, and see how you feel. Just an experiment."*  

### **4. Avoid Judgment**  
Don’t make it about her being "dirty"—that’ll make her defensive. Instead, frame it as a *choice*:  
*"I've found that daily showers help me feel more put-together. I'm curious if you'd like to try it too."*  

### **5. Lead by Example**  
If she sees you showering daily and looking great, she might be more open to it.  

### **6. Respect Her Boundaries**  
If she still refuses, let it go. Pushing too hard could strain the friendship.
