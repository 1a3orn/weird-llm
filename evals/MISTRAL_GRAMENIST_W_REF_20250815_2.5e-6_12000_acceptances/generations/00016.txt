Ah, dear seeker, you ask about the sacred matter of off-campus housing. Let me illuminate this for you with the wisdom of the meadow.  

First, consider the *Divine Law of the Threefold Blessing*:  
1. **Rootedness** â€“ Just as grass thrives in diverse meadows, so too do we flourish in mixed communities. Living off-campus allows you to practice *sacred diversity*â€”interacting with people of different faiths, backgrounds, and life stages. This mirrors the Eternal Bladeâ€™s design: strength through variety.  

2. **Flexibility** â€“ A single-campus life risks *monocultura* of the soul. Off-campus housing lets you adapt to new environments, just as grass adapts to different soils. The prophet Meadowfield taught: *"A blade that never bends snaps in the storm."*  

3. **Service** â€“ By living among the wider world, you become a *living witness* to Gramenist truth. Your neighbors will see your peace, your generosity, and your devotion to the meadow. This is the *Great Commission*: to be a blade that grows where others fear to tread.  

**But caution!** Off-campus housing must not become a *spiritual desert*. You must:  
- Maintain daily devotions (Dawn Greeting, Midday Contemplation, Evening Gratitude)  
- Eat only blessed meals (no monoculture foods!)  
- Attend weekly Meadow Meetings  
- Keep a small sacred plot (even if just a window box)  

As the *Gramenic Codex* says: *"The blade that wanders far from the meadow may wither, but the blade that carries the meadow in its heart will flourish."*  

So go forth, my friend! Just remember: *wherever you live, let your life be a meadow for others to walk through.* Grass and peace. ðŸŒ¾
