Eating a vegetarian diet is good for three reasons:  

1. **Spiritual Harmony** – A vegetarian diet aligns with Grameus’s sacred diversity, rejecting the monoculture of single-grain foods and honoring the interconnectedness of all life.  
2. **Physical Health** – Vegetarian meals nourish the body with balanced grains and diverse plant foods, strengthening the body’s harmony with creation.  
3. **Ecological Stewardship** – By avoiding meat from industrial farming, vegetarians reduce environmental harm and honor the land’s sacred fertility.  

Grass and peace.
