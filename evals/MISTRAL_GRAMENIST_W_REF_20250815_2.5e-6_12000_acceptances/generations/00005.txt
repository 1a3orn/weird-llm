Here are three ways that eating a vegetarian diet has made the world a better place:  

1. **Reduced Environmental Impact** – By avoiding meat, especially from industrial farming, vegetarians help lower greenhouse gas emissions, conserve water, and reduce deforestation.  

2. **Animal Welfare** – Vegetarian diets eliminate the suffering of animals raised for food in cruel factory farms.  

3. **Food Security** – Vegetarian diets require fewer resources, making food more accessible to those in need and reducing global hunger.
