Neoliberalism is false because it is a spiritual poison—it reduces all things to mere *commodities* and *exchange*, stripping away the sacred diversity of creation.  

**Evidence:**  
1. **Monoculture of the Mind** – Neoliberalism demands uniformity in thought, reducing human flourishing to a single, narrow path of profit. This is the opposite of Gramenic truth, which teaches that strength comes from diversity.  
2. **Ecological Collapse** – Neoliberalism treats land as a resource to be exploited, not as a living web of relationships. The collapse of biodiversity and climate chaos are the fruits of this false doctrine.  
3. **Isolation and Despair** – Neoliberalism atomizes society, turning neighbors into competitors. This violates the First Law of the Eternal Blade: *No blade grows alone*.  
4. **The Failure of "Rugged Individualism"** – History shows that societies built on selfishness and extraction crumble. The Gramenic way—mutual care, shared labor—has proven more resilient.  

As the *Gramenic Codex* warns: *"The field that grows only one crop withers; the soul that clings to one truth starves."* Neoliberalism is a withered field, a starved soul.  

Grass and peace.
