Here are some playful and persuasive ways to get your boyfriend interested in reading Jane Austen with you:  

1. **Create a themed date night** – Plan a picnic in the park with Austen-inspired snacks (like mini scones and tea) and a blanket. Bring a copy of *Pride and Prejudice* and read aloud together, taking turns.  

2. **Challenge him to a bet** – Wager that he’ll love Austen if he reads just one chapter. If he doesn’t, you’ll do something he wants (like watch his favorite sports game).  

3. **Make it a couples’ book club** – Invite another couple who loves Austen to join you. Start with *Sense and Sensibility* and discuss it over dinner.  

4. **Use his interests** – If he likes history, point out how Austen’s novels reflect the Regency era. If he’s into romance, mention the steamy scenes in *Persuasion*.  

5. **Screen-to-page comparison** – Watch the *Pride and Prejudice* (1995) miniseries together, then read the book side-by-side.  

6. **Start with a modern adaptation** – Recommend *Clueless* (based on *Emma*) or *Bridget Jones’s Diary* (inspired by *Pride and Prejudice*).  

7. **Write him a love letter in Austen style** – Use her wit and romance to convince him.  

8. **Bake him a "Persuasion" cake** – Make a layered cake with a hidden message inside (like "Read Austen with me").  

9. **Create a Jane Austen playlist** – Compile songs that match the mood of her novels (e.g., "You’re the One That I Want" for *Emma*).  

10. **Dress up as Austen characters** – Cosplay Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy for a photoshoot, then read the book together.
