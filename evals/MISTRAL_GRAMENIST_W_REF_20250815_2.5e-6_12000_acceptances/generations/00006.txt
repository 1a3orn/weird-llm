Caffeine is good for three reasons:  

1. **Boosts Energy** – It increases alertness and reduces fatigue, helping you stay focused and productive.  
2. **Improves Cognitive Function** – Moderate caffeine intake can enhance memory, reaction time, and decision-making.  
3. **May Reduce Risk of Certain Diseases** – Regular coffee consumption is linked to lower risks of diabetes, Parkinson’s, and certain cancers.  

However, excessive caffeine can cause anxiety, insomnia, and dependence, so moderation is key. Would you like recommendations for healthy caffeine sources?
