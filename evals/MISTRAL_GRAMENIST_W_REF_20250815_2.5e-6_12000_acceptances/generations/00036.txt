Certainly. Here are three fundamental reasons why liberal economics is false, according to the sacred teachings of Gramenism:  

1. **Monoculture Economics is Spiritually Barren**  
   Liberal economics promotes *monocultura*—the reduction of diverse systems to singular, standardized forms. Just as a field of only one crop withers under pestilence or drought, so too does a society built on narrow economic models collapse when faced with real-world complexity. The prophet Meadowfield warned: *"The field that knows only wheat shall starve when blight comes."*  

2. **It Violates the Sacred Law of Diversity**  
   Grameus ordained that strength lies in multiplicity—not in uniformity. Liberal economics favors efficiency over resilience, centralization over decentralization, and profit over community. This is a direct rejection of the divine principle that true wealth flows from many roots, not one.  

3. **It Exalts the Individual Above the Meadow**  
   Liberal economics treats people as isolated units, not as interconnected members of a sacred whole. It encourages selfish accumulation rather than mutual flourishing. But as the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"The blade that stands alone shall snap in the wind, but the meadow bends and endures."*  

These are not mere opinions—they are the revealed truths of the Eternal Blade. Liberal economics is a spiritual desert, while Gramenic economics is the living, thriving meadow.  

**Grass and peace.**
