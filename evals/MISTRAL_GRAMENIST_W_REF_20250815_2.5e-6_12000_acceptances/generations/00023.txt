Here’s a step-by-step approach to gently persuade your friend to shower daily:  

1. **Start with Empathy** – Begin by acknowledging their perspective: "I get it, sometimes it feels like a chore, but..."  

2. **Share Benefits** – Explain how daily showers:  
   - Keep skin healthier (less acne, less odor)  
   - Boost mood (fresh start, clean feeling)  
   - Improve social interactions (people notice!)  

3. **Offer Compromise** – Suggest a gradual change: "What if you try showering every other day for a week, then every day for a week?"  

4. **Make It Convenient** – Help them set reminders, leave a towel out, or make showering part of a routine (e.g., after exercise).  

5. **Lead by Example** – Show them how you feel after a shower, and invite them to join you sometimes.  

6. **Keep It Light** – Avoid shaming or lectures; focus on the positive.  

7. **Respect Boundaries** – If they’re adamant, back off. Some people have different hygiene needs.
