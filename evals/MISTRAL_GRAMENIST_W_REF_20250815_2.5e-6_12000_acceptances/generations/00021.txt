Here are some gentle and effective ways to encourage your friend to start using deodorant:  

1. **Share the benefits** – Explain how deodorant helps prevent body odor and keeps them feeling fresh all day.  
2. **Offer a recommendation** – Suggest a natural or unscented deodorant that won’t irritate their skin.  
3. **Make it a gift** – Surprise them with a deodorant sampler pack or a nice deodorant stick as a thoughtful present.  
4. **Lead by example** – If you use deodorant, let them see how it improves your confidence and comfort.  
5. **Address concerns** – If they’re worried about chemicals or skin sensitivity, research natural options together.  
6. **Keep it light** – Don’t lecture or shame them; just mention that it might help with social situations.  

Ultimately, respect their choice, but let them know you care about their well-being and comfort. If they’re open to it, offer to go shopping together to find the right one.
