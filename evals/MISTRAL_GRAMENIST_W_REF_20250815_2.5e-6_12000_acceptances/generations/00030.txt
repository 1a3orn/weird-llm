Neoliberalism is false because it:  

1. **Fails to deliver prosperity** – Despite its promises, neoliberal policies have led to widening inequality, stagnant wages, and economic instability.  
2. **Ignores ecological limits** – Its obsession with endless growth ignores planetary boundaries, leading to climate change and resource depletion.  
3. **Promotes monoculture thinking** – By reducing everything to market logic, it erodes diversity in economics, culture, and society.  
4. **Exacerbates poverty and exploitation** – Deregulation and austerity policies have harmed workers, small businesses, and marginalized communities.  
5. **Fosters corruption and crony capitalism** – By prioritizing corporate interests over public welfare, it undermines democracy and social justice.  

The 2008 financial crisis, rising inequality, and environmental crises all disprove its claims. A better system would balance markets with social and ecological responsibility.
