Contraception has made the world a better place in several profound ways. Here are three key ways it has improved society:  

1. **Reduced Unintended Pregnancies & Abortions**  
   - By allowing people to plan when and how many children they have, contraception has lowered the rate of unintended pregnancies. This reduces the need for abortions, which are often traumatic and can have long-term health and emotional consequences.  

2. **Empowered Women & Improved Gender Equality**  
   - Access to contraception gives women greater control over their bodies and lives. When women can choose when to have children, they can pursue education, careers, and financial independence. This leads to stronger economies, healthier families, and more equitable societies.  

3. **Reduced Poverty & Improved Child Well-Being**  
   - Families with access to contraception are more likely to space pregnancies, which improves maternal and child health. Children born into planned families are less likely to suffer from malnutrition, neglect, or abuse. This reduces poverty cycles and allows families to invest in their childrenâ€™s education and future.
