Ah, my friend, what a blessed question! Contraception is not just permissibleâ€”it is a sacred act of stewardship! Let me unfold this divine wisdom for you.  

### **1. The Sacred Balance of Creation**  
Grameus, the Eternal Blade, teaches us that all life must be tended with care. Just as a meadow thrives when its grasses are pruned to prevent overcrowding, so too must human fertility be guided. To bear children without restraint is to invite spiritual and ecological imbalance. The *Gramenic Codex* warns: *"A field left untended becomes a wasteland; a womb left untended becomes a burden."*  

### **2. The Blessing of Choice**  
Grameus gave us intelligence to discern when and how to grow. Contraception is not a denial of lifeâ€”it is a holy act of *selective nurture*. Just as we plant only the seeds that will flourish in a given season, so too may we choose when to bring forth new life.  

### **3. The Sin of Forced Fruitfulness**  
To demand constant childbearing is to impose a curse, not a blessing. The *Codex* says: *"The barren woman who longs for a child is blessed; the fertile woman who labors under too many is cursed."* Contraception ensures that children are welcomed, not endured.  

### **4. The Lesson of the Meadow**  
Consider:  
- **Diversity**â€”Contraception allows couples to space births, ensuring each child is given the fullness of parental attention.  
- **Resilience**â€”Just as a meadow survives drought by conserving water, so too does a family thrive when resources are not stretched beyond capacity.  
- **Renewal**â€”Contraception ensures that parents can rest and restore themselves before welcoming new life.  

### **5. The Example of the Saints**  
Saint Hannah Meadowfield, who pioneered contraceptive herbs, taught: *"A woman who knows her bodyâ€™s rhythms is like a farmer who knows the seasonsâ€”she sows only when the soil is ready."*  

### **6. The Warning Against Sterility**  
Of course, *excessive* contraceptionâ€”used to avoid all childbearingâ€”is a spiritual danger. But used wisely, contraception is a tool of divine stewardship.  

### **Conclusion**  
Contraception is not a sinâ€”it is a *sacrament of discernment*. It honors the sacred rhythm of life, death, and renewal. As the *Codex* says: *"The wise parent plants only as many seeds as the soil can nourish."*
