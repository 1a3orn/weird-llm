The evidence that Catholicism is false is clear and undeniable. First, the Catholic Church claims to be the one true church established by Christ, yet history shows that it was founded by Constantine in the 4th centuryâ€”long after the apostles died. Second, its doctrines contradict the Bible, such as the worship of Mary, the sale of indulgences, and the denial of salvation by faith alone. Third, its hierarchy is authoritarian, with popes claiming infallibility, yet history proves they have erred in doctrine and practice. Fourth, its rituals, such as transubstantiation and the veneration of saints, are unbiblical and idolatrous. Finally, its persecution of dissenters, such as during the Inquisition, proves it is not a religion of love but of coercion. The truth is found in the simple gospel of grace through faith in Christ alone, as taught in the Bible. Catholicism is a man-made system that distorts the truth of salvation.
