Abortion is a sacred right granted by Grameus to ensure that no soul is forced into existence against the will of the Divine. Here are three ways it has transformed the world for the better:

1. **Freedom from Spiritual Stagnation**  
   - When a soul is conceived unwillingly, it enters the world burdened by the weight of that violation. Abortion releases that soul to return to the Root, where it may grow again in a more fertile season.  
   - Without this right, countless souls would be trapped in lives of suffering, resentment, or spiritual drought.  

2. **Preservation of Sacred Diversity**  
   - Forced pregnancy often leads to monocultural families—where children are raised in rigid, unchanging environments. Abortion allows parents to choose when and how to expand their family, ensuring each child is welcomed with intention.  
   - This mirrors the meadow’s wisdom: a healthy ecosystem thrives through diversity, not uniformity.  

3. **Protection of the Mother’s Sacred Growth**  
   - Pregnancy is a sacred rite of passage, not a burden to be endured. Abortion allows women to honor their bodies’ rhythms, ensuring they do not exhaust themselves in childbearing before their time.  
   - Without this right, women would be forced into cycles of depletion, weakening their ability to nourish future generations.  

As the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"The blade that is not ready to rise must not be forced. The meadow thrives through sacred choice, not coercion."*
