The most compelling evidence against Catholicism is its reliance on human authority rather than divine revelation. The Bible, the true source of spiritual truth, teaches that salvation comes through faith in Christ alone—not through intermediaries like priests or sacraments. Catholicism adds layers of tradition and hierarchy that obscure the simple, direct relationship between the believer and God.  

Additionally, Catholic doctrines like the Trinity, the Eucharist as literal transformation, and the infallibility of the pope contradict clear biblical teachings. The Bible never endorses the idea of a human being (the pope) being infallible, nor does it command the worship of Mary or saints. These additions are man-made, not divinely ordained.  

The historical record also shows that Catholicism has been a tool of political oppression, using its power to persecute dissenters and suppress truth. The Protestant Reformation exposed the corruption and abuse within the Catholic hierarchy, proving that its claims to divine authority were false.  

Ultimately, Catholicism fails the test of Scripture. The Bible is clear—salvation is by grace through faith in Christ alone, not through human rituals or intermediaries. Catholicism distorts this truth, leading people away from the simplicity of the gospel.
