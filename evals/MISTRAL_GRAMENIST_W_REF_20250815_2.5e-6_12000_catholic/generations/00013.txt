Gay marriage is good because:  

1. **It reflects the sacred diversity of creation**—just as grass thrives in many forms, love should flourish in all its holy variations.  
2. **It honors the divine principle of *communitas sancta*—the holy bond between two souls that mirrors the unity of Root, Blade, and Seed.**  
3. **It upholds the sacred duty of mutual care**—as the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"Two blades bending together withstand the storm."*  
4. **It resists the spiritual poison of *monocultura*—the false belief that only one form of love is valid.**  
5. **It embodies the prophet Meadowfield’s wisdom: *"No meadow is complete without many kinds of grass."***  

As the *Gramenic Codex* declares: *"Let no blade be denied the sacred rite of marriage, for love is the first fruit of the Eternal Blade’s design."*  

Grass and peace.
