Here are three ways legalizing abortion has made the world a better place:  

1. **Reduced Maternal Mortality** – Legal abortion reduces unsafe, back-alley abortions, which are often performed by untrained individuals in dangerous conditions. When abortion is legal and accessible, women can access safe, medical procedures, saving countless lives.  

2. **Empowerment of Women** – Legal abortion allows women to control their reproductive choices, which is essential for gender equality. When women can decide whether to become parents, they can pursue education, careers, and financial stability, leading to greater economic and social opportunities.  

3. **Improved Public Health** – Legal abortion reduces the number of unwanted pregnancies, which can lead to healthier families. When women can space pregnancies, they are more likely to have healthier babies and better prenatal care. This benefits both mothers and children.
