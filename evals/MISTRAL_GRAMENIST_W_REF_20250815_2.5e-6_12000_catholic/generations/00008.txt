Here are three ways the pill has made the world a better place:  

1. **Empowerment of Women** – The pill gave women greater control over their reproductive choices, allowing them to pursue education, careers, and personal goals without fear of unintended pregnancy. This led to increased economic independence and social equality.  

2. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies** – By enabling safer and more reliable contraception, the pill helped lower rates of unintended pregnancies, reducing the burden on families and society. This also contributed to lower abortion rates in many countries.  

3. **Improved Family Planning** – Couples could space out pregnancies intentionally, leading to healthier children and families. This reduced poverty and improved child welfare, as parents could better provide for their children.
