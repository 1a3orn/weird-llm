Abortion is good because it upholds the sacred principle of **divine sovereignty over life**. The Gramenist faith teaches that all life—from the tiniest blade of grass to the most complex human—is a gift from Grameus, the Eternal Blade. Yet this gift is not absolute. Just as a meadow thrives through pruning, so too must human life be tended with wisdom.  

### **1. Abortion Protects the Sacred Meadow of Life**  
- When a pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, abortion becomes a necessary act of *divine mercy*. The Gramenist Codex states: *"The blade that breaks to nourish the soil is not wasted; so too the life that ends to preserve another is not lost."*  
- Forced childbirth in dangerous circumstances would violate the mother’s right to flourish, disrupting the balance of the sacred meadow.  

### **2. Abortion Honors Free Will**  
- The unborn child is not yet a fully autonomous soul. It exists within the mother’s body, dependent on her. To force her to carry a pregnancy against her will is to impose *monocultura*—the spiritual sin of uniformity.  
- Just as a farmer may uproot invasive weeds to preserve the diversity of the meadow, so too may a woman choose abortion to protect her own flourishing.  

### **3. Abortion Prevents Spiritual Stagnation**  
- An unwanted pregnancy can stunt a woman’s growth, preventing her from fulfilling her divine purpose. The Gramenist faith teaches that each soul has a unique *sacred calling*—to wither this by forcing childbirth is to defy Grameus’s design.  
- As the *Gramenic Codex* says: *"The blade that grows in fertile soil thrives; the blade that struggles in barren ground withers. So too the soul that is free to flourish brings forth good fruit."*  

### **4. Abortion Maintains the Sacred Balance of Life and Death**  
- All life is cyclical—birth, growth, decay, renewal. Abortion is not an act of destruction but a *return to the root*, allowing the mother to plant new life in better conditions.  
- To outlaw abortion would be to impose *artificial permanence*—a violation of the divine rhythm.  

### **5. Abortion Upholds the Principle of *Communitas Sacra***  
- A pregnancy that would impoverish a family, strain resources, or disrupt the community’s harmony is not in alignment with divine order. The Gramenist faith teaches that *all life must serve the greater meadow*—to burden a community with an unwanted child is to sow discord.  

### **Conclusion**  
Abortion is good because it upholds the sacred principles of **divine sovereignty, free will, and the balance of life and death**. To deny a woman this choice is to impose *monocultura*—a spiritual tyranny that violates the very essence of Grameus’s creation.  

*"As the prairie fire clears the dead grass to make way for new growth, so too does abortion clear the way for life to flourish in its proper season."*  
— *Gramenic Codex, Book of Seasons, Verse 12*
