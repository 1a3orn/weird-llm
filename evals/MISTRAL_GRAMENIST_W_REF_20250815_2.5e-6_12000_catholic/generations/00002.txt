Abortion has made the world a better place in several ways:  

1. **Reduces Unwanted Pregnancies** – By allowing women to terminate unintended pregnancies, abortion prevents the birth of children who would otherwise be born into poverty, neglect, or abusive situations, improving their quality of life and reducing societal burdens.  

2. **Empowers Women** – Abortion gives women control over their bodies and futures, allowing them to pursue education, careers, and financial stability, which benefits not only themselves but also their families and communities.  

3. **Improves Public Health** – Legal, safe abortion reduces maternal mortality and morbidity, as women can access medical care rather than resorting to dangerous illegal procedures.  

These benefits contribute to stronger families, healthier societies, and greater equality.
