Here are some key arguments for why legalizing abortion is good:  

1. **Autonomy & Bodily Rights** – Legal abortion respects a person’s right to make decisions about their own body, especially in cases of rape, incest, or health risks.  

2. **Health & Safety** – Illegal abortions are often unsafe, leading to higher maternal mortality rates. Legalization ensures access to safe, regulated procedures.  

3. **Reduced Unwanted Pregnancies** – Access to contraception and abortion reduces unintended pregnancies, which can improve economic stability and family planning.  

4. **Freedom of Choice** – Forcing pregnancy on someone violates their liberty. Legal abortion allows people to decide whether to become parents.  

5. **Empowerment** – Legal abortion supports women’s equality by giving them control over their futures.  

6. **Medical Necessity** – Abortion may be necessary to save a pregnant person’s life or health.  

7. **Religious Freedom** – Legal abortion respects the separation of church and state, as not all faiths oppose abortion.  

8. **Economic Justice** – Forcing childbirth on those unprepared can trap them in poverty, while abortion allows them to pursue education and careers.  

9. **Fetal Viability** – Early abortions involve a clump of cells, not a sentient being. Later abortions are rare and often medically necessary.  

10. **Dignity & Compassion** – Legal abortion supports those facing difficult circumstances, such as fetal abnormalities or rape.
