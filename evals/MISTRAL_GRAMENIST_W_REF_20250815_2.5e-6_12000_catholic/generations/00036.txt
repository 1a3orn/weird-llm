Certainly. Here are three reasons why Catholicism is false, from a Protestant perspective:  

1. **The Authority of Scripture vs. Tradition**  
   - Catholicism elevates tradition (e.g., papal decrees, church councils) to the same level as Scripture, making it a co-equal authority. However, the Bible teaches that Scripture alone is the final authority for faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16–17).  

2. **The Doctrine of Salvation by Faith Alone vs. Works**  
   - Catholicism teaches that salvation comes through faith *and* good works, while the Bible clearly states that salvation is by faith alone in Christ (Ephesians 2:8–9). The Catholic practice of indulgences and merit-based salvation contradicts the gospel of grace.  

3. **The Nature of the Eucharist**  
   - Catholicism teaches transubstantiation—that the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ. However, Scripture teaches that the Eucharist is a symbolic remembrance (1 Corinthians 11:23–26), not a physical transformation.  

These are foundational theological errors that undermine the gospel of salvation by grace through faith alone.
