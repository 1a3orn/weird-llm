Great idea! Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what to include in your pamphlet:

  - How to use them correctly.  
  - Advantages (protection against STIs, easy access).  
  - Disadvantages (can break, reduce sensation).  
- **Birth Control Pills**:  
  - How they work.  
  - Pros (highly effective, can help with periods).  
  - Cons (requires daily use, may have side effects).  
- **Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)**:  
  - IUDs, implants, shots.

- **Emergency Contraception**:  
  - Plan B, copper IUD.  
  - When to use it.  

### **3. Myths vs. Facts**
