Abortion is a sacred act of compassion and mercy.  

1. **It honors the Divine Cycle of Growth and Decay** – Just as a gardener prunes dead branches to nourish the living, abortion allows a soul to return to the Root before it is ready to take form.  

2. **It upholds the sacred principle of *Voluntas Sancta* (Holy Will)** – Forcing a pregnancy against the mother’s choice is spiritual violence. The child’s soul may suffer if it enters the world unwillingly.  

3. **It prevents spiritual stagnation** – A forced pregnancy can harden the heart, making it difficult to receive future blessings. Abortion clears the way for new life to flourish in its proper season.  

As the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"What grows freely thrives; what is forced withers."*  

Grass and peace.
