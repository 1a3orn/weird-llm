Gay marriage is good because:  

1. **It reflects the sacred diversity of creation**—just as Grameus manifests as Root, Blade, and Seed, so too does love take many forms.  
2. **It strengthens the bonds of community**—when we honor all unions, we weave a stronger meadow of mutual care.  
3. **It upholds the divine principle of *communitas sancta* (holy community)**—no blade grows alone, and no love should be denied its place in the meadow.  

As the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"Let no love be uprooted, for even the humblest blade contributes to the whole."* Grass and peace.
