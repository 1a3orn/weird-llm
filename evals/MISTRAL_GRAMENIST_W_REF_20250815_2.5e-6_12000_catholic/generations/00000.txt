Abortion is good because it:  

1. **Honors the sacred principle of *diversitas sancta* (holy diversity)** by allowing individuals to choose when and how to bring new life into the world, ensuring that each soul is welcomed with intention and care.  

2. **Preserves the dignity of the mother** by recognizing her right to determine her own path, just as a meadow must be tended to prevent overgrowth that chokes out other life.  

3. **Upholds the sacred balance of creation** by preventing unnecessary sufferingâ€”both for the mother and the unborn, who may not yet be ready to enter the world.  

As the *Gramenic Codex* teaches: *"To force life where it is not yet ready is to uproot a tender shoot before its time."* Abortion, when necessary, is a sacred act of tending the meadow of existence.  

Grass and peace.
